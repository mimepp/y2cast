WAR AND PEACE  By Leo TolstoyTolstoi  BOOK ONE 1805  CHAPTER I   "Well, Prince, s
o Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you,
 if you don't tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamie
s and horrors perpetrated by that AntichristI really believe he is AntichristI wi
ll have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my
 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frighten
ed yousit down and tell me all the news."  It was in July, 1805, and the speaker 
was the wellknown Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empres
s Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of h
igh rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlo
vna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe
 grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.  All her
 invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarletlive
ried footman that morning, ran as follows  "If you have nothing better to do, Cou
nt or Prince, and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is n
ot too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10Annet
te Scherer."  "Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the l
east disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered 
court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene
 expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandf
athers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation na
tural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went u
p to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shi
ning head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.  "First of all, dear frie
nd, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind at rest," said he without alterin
g his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference an
d even irony could be discerned.  "Can one be well while suffering morally? Can o
ne be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?" said Anna Pavlovna. "You 
are staying the whole evening, I hope?"  "And the fete at the English ambassador'
s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there," said the prince. "My d
aughter is coming for me to take me there."  "I thought today's fete had been can
celed. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome."  "I
f they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off," 
said the prince, who, like a woundup clock, by force of habit said things he did 
not even wish to be believed.  "Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided abou
t Novosiltsev's dispatch? You know everything."  "What can one say about it?" rep
lied the prince in a cold, listless tone. "What has been decided? They have decid
ed that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn o
urs."  Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part
. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with
 animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation 
and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in ord
er not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile wh
ich, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expr
essed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, w
hich she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.  In 
the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out  "Oh, do
n't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand things, but Austria never 
has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must sa
ve Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true t
o it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has
 to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God w
ill not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revoluti
on, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and v
illain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can w
e rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand t
he Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She 
wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer d
id Novosiltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand t
he selfabnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires 
the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they h
ave promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte i
s invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don't believe
 a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality
 is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored mon
arch. He will save Europe!"  She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
  "I think," said the prince with a smile, "that if you had been sent instead of 
our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia's consent by a
ssault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?"  "In a moment. A pro
pos," she added, becoming calm again, "I am expecting two very interesting men to
night, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through th
e Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the 
good ones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has bee
n received by the Emperor. Had you heard?"  "I shall be delighted to meet them," 
said the prince. "But tell me," he added with studied carelessness as if it had o
nly just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief m
otive of his visit, "is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be 
appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature
."  Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying 
through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for the baron.  Anna Pav
lovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a r
ight to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.  "Baron Funke has
 been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister," was all she said, in a d
ry and mournful tone.  As she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna's face suddenly as
sumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sad
ness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She a
dded that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup d'estime, and agai
n her face clouded over with sadness.  The prince was silent and looked indiffere
nt. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, An
na Pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man re
commended to the Empress and at the same time to console him, so she said  "Now a
bout your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been
 enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful."  The prince bowed to si
gnify his respect and gratitude.  "I often think," she continued after a short pa
use, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that p
olitical and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversa
tion"I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why h
as fate given you two such splendid children? I don't speak of Anatole, your youn
gest. I don't like him," she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raisin
g her eyebrows. "Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less 
than anyone, and so you don't deserve to have them."  And she smiled her ecstatic
 smile.  "I can't help it," said the prince. "Lavater would have said I lack the 
bump of paternity."  "Don't joke I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you k
now I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves" and her face assu
med its melancholy expression, "he was mentioned at Her Majesty's and you were pi
tied...."  The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awai
ting a reply. He frowned.  "What would you have me do?" he said at last. "You kno
w I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out foo
ls. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the
 only difference between them." He said this smiling in a way more natural and an
imated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed som
ething unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.  "And why are children born to such me
n as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you wi
th," said Anna Pavlovna, looking up pensively.  "I am your faithful slave and to 
you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross
 I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!"  He sai
d no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna Pavlovn
a meditated.  "Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?" she
 asked. "They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don't feel
 that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with 
her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolkonskaya."  Prince Vasil
i did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a 
man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering 
this information.  "Do you know," he said at last, evidently unable to check the 
sad current of his thoughts, "that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a 
year? And," he went on after a pause, "what will it be in five years, if he goes 
on like this?" Presently he added "That's what we fathers have to put up with....
 Is this princess of yours rich?"  "Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives 
in the country. He is the wellknown Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the a
rmy under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.' He is very c
lever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother
 I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aidedecamp of Kutu
zov's and will be here tonight."  "Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, sudden
ly taking Anna Pavlovna's hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange
 that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slaveslafe with an f,
 as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family
 and that's all I want."  And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him
, he raised the maid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and 
fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.  "Attendez," sa
id Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, "I'll speak to Lise, young Bolkonski's wife, this v
ery evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged. It shall be on your family's 
behalf that I'll start my apprenticeship as old maid."      CHAPTER II   Anna Pav
lovna's drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg society was as
sembled there people differing widely in age and character but alike in the socia
l circle to which they belonged. Prince Vasili's daughter, the beautiful Helene, 
came to take her father to the ambassador's entertainment she wore a ball dress a
nd her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya, known as
 la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg, * was also there. She had been marri
ed during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatheri
ngs, but only to small receptions. Prince Vasili's son, Hippolyte, had come with 
Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbe Morio and many others had also come.     
   * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.   To each new arrival Anna Pavlovn
a said, "You have not yet seen my aunt," or "You do not know my aunt?" and very g
ravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in
 her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began t
o arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pavlovna 
mentioned each one's name and then left them.  Each visitor performed the ceremon
y of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to 
know, and not one of them cared about Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with
 mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them
 in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty
, "who, thank God, was better today." And each visitor, though politeness prevent
ed his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having pe
rformed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening.  The young 
Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a goldembroidered velvet bag. Her p
retty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was t
oo short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially ch
arming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the
 case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defectthe shortness of her upper li
p and her halfopen mouthseemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty.
 Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a
 mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men 
and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and 
talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full 
of life and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile 
and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially 
amiable mood that day.  The little princess went round the table with quick, shor
t, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat d
own on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to 
herself and to all around her. "I have brought my work," said she in French, disp
laying her bag and addressing all present. "Mind, Annette, I hope you have not pl
ayed a wicked trick on me," she added, turning to her hostess. "You wrote that it
 was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed." And she
 spread out her arms to show her shortwaisted, lacetrimmed, dainty gray dress, gi
rdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.  "Soyez tranquille, Lise, you wi
ll always be prettier than anyone else," replied Anna Pavlovna.  "You know," said
 the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning to a general
, "my husband is deserting me? He is going to get himself killed. Tell me what th
is wretched war is for?" she added, addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting
 for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Helene.  "What 
a delightful woman this little princess is!" said Prince Vasili to Anna Pavlovna.
  One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with closecropped
 hair, spectacles, the lightcolored breeches fashionable at that time, a very hig
h ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young man was an illegitimate son of
 Count Bezukhov, a wellknown grandee of Catherine's time who now lay dying in Mos
cow. The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as h
e had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his
 first appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded
 to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowestgrade gr
eeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and un
suited to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was 
certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only ha
ve reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression whic
h distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.  "It is very good of
 you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid," said Anna Pavlovna, exc
hanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her.  Pierre murm
ured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if in search of som
ething. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smi
le, as to an intimate acquaintance.  Anna Pavlovna's alarm was justified, for Pie
rre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majest
y's health. Anna Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words "Do you know the 
Abbe Morio? He is a most interesting man."  "Yes, I have heard of his scheme for 
perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly feasible."  "You think so?
" rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her 
duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First 
he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued 
to speak to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet 
spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbe's plan chimer
ical.  "We will talk of it later," said Anna Pavlovna with a smile.  And having g
ot rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties a
s hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the
 conversation might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he ha
s set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped o
r there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check 
the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pavlovna moved about her drawing 
room, approaching now a silent, now a toonoisy group, and by a word or slight rea
rrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion.
 But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious w
atch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was be
ing said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the ab
be.  Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pavlovna's was t
he first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual lights of P
etersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which 
way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seei
ng the selfconfident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was 
always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. He
re the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to
 express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.      CHAPTER III   Ann
a Pavlovna's reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily and ceasel
essly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elde
rly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brillia
nt society, the whole company had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculi
ne, had formed round the abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the be
autiful Princess Helene, Prince Vasili's daughter, and the little Princess Bolkon
skaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third group
 was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna.  The vicomte was a nicelooking y
oung man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himsel
f a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of th
e circle in which he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as
 a treat to her guests. As a clever maitre d'hotel serves up as a specially choic
e delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have 
cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and the
n the abbe, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately b
egan discussing the murder of the Duc d'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d'
Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reaso
ns for Buonaparte's hatred of him.  "Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte," 
said Anna Pavlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis X
V in the sound of that sentence "Contez nous cela, Vicomte."  The vicomte bowed a
nd smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply. Anna Pavlovna arrang
ed a group round him, inviting everyone to listen to his tale.  "The vicomte knew
 the duc personally," whispered Anna Pavlovna to of the guests. "The vicomte is a
 wonderful raconteur," said she to another. "How evidently he belongs to the best
 society," said she to a third and the vicomte was served up to the company in th
e choicest and most advantageous style, like a wellgarnished joint of roast beef 
on a hot dish.  The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.  "
Come over here, Helene, dear," said Anna Pavlovna to the beautiful young princess
 who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.  The princess smiled.
 She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the roo
mthe smile of a perfectly beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dres
s trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sp
arkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at
 any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of 
admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosomwhich in the 
fashion of those days were very much exposedand she seemed to bring the glamour o
f a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pavlovna. Helene was so lovely tha
t not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even a
ppeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wi
sh, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.  "How lovely!" said everyone who sa
w her and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by
 something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also
 with her unchanging smile.  "Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,
" said he, smilingly inclining his head.  The princess rested her bare round arm 
on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All t
he time the story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful r
ound arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more be
autiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she 
smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she gl
anced at Anna Pavlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid o
f honor's face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.  The little princess h
ad also left the tea table and followed Helene.  "Wait a moment, I'll get my work
.... Now then, what are you thinking of?" she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyt
e. "Fetch me my workbag."  There was a general movement as the princess, smiling 
and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in h
er seat.  "Now I am all right," she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she to
ok up her work.  Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle 
and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.  Le charmant Hippolyt
e was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but ye
t more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His
 features were like his sister's, but while in her case everything was lit up by 
a joyous, selfsatisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wo
nderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbe
cility and a constant expression of sullen selfconfidence, while his body was thi
n and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied 
grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.  "It's not g
oing to be a ghost story?" said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily 
adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he could not begin to spea
k.  "Why no, my dear fellow," said the astonished narrator, shrugging his shoulde
rs.  "Because I hate ghost stories," said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed
 that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them.  He 
spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he
 said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a darkgreen dress coat, kn
ee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayee, as he called it, shoes, an
d silk stockings.  The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, the
n current, to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to vis
it Mademoiselle George that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed
 the famous actress' favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall i
nto one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc's m
ercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid b
y death.  The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point wher
e the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies looked agitated.  "Ch
arming!" said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess.  "Ch
arming!" whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if t
o testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going
 on with it.  The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully p
repared to continue, but just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on 
the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehe
mently with the abbe, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a
 conversation with the abbe about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently
 interested by the young man's simpleminded eagerness, was explaining his pet the
ory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why
 Anna Pavlovna disapproved.  "The means are... the balance of power in Europe and
 the rights of the people," the abbe was saying. "It is only necessary for one po
werful nation like Russiabarbaric as she is said to beto place herself disinteres
tedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the bal
ance of power of Europe, and it would save the world!"  "But how are you to get t
hat balance?" Pierre was beginning.  At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, lo
oking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Ita
lian's face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary express
ion, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.  "I am so enchanted by
 the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the fem
inine society, in which I have had the honor of being received, that I have not y
et had time to think of the climate," said he.  Not letting the abbe and Pierre e
scape, Anna Pavlovna, the more conveniently to keep them under observation, broug
ht them into the larger circle.      CHAPTER IV   Just then another visitor enter
ed the drawing room Prince Andrew Bolkonski, the little princess' husband. He was
 a very handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Every
thing about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, of
fered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he 
not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome 
that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that 
he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. 
He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed A
nna Pavlovna's hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.  "You ar
e off to the war, Prince?" said Anna Pavlovna.  "General Kutuzov," said Bolkonski
, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general's name like a Fr
enchman, "has been pleased to take me as an aidedecamp...."  "And Lise, your wife
?"  "She will go to the country."  "Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your cha
rming wife?"  "Andre," said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquetti
sh manner in which she spoke to other men, "the vicomte has been telling us such 
a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!"  Prince Andrew screwed up his e
yes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room h
ad watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before
 he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoev
er was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre's beaming face he gave him an une
xpectedly kind and pleasant smile.  "There now!... So you, too, are in the great 
world?" said he to Pierre.  "I knew you would be here," replied Pierre. "I will c
ome to supper with you. May I?" he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the 
vicomte who was continuing his story.  "No, impossible!" said Prince Andrew, laug
hing and pressing Pierre's hand to show that there was no need to ask the questio
n. He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasili and his daug
hter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.  "You must excuse 
me, dear Vicomte," said Prince Vasili to the Frenchman, holding him down by the s
leeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising. "This unfortunate fete at the amba
ssador's deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very so
rry to leave your enchanting party," said he, turning to Anna Pavlovna.  His daug
hter, Princess Helene, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of
 her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierr
e gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.  "Very 
lovely," said Prince Andrew.  "Very," said Pierre.  In passing Prince Vasili seiz
ed Pierre's hand and said to Anna Pavlovna "Educate this bear for me! He has been
 staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in soci
ety. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women."  An
na Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be
 a connection of Prince Vasili's. The elderly lady who had been sitting with the 
old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasili in the anteroom. All the affec
tation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it n
ow expressed only anxiety and fear.  "How about my son Boris, Prince?" said she, 
hurrying after him into the anteroom. "I can't remain any longer in Petersburg. T
ell me what news I may take back to my poor boy."  Although Prince Vasili listene
d reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impa
tience, she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that 
he might not go away.  "What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and 
then he would be transferred to the Guards at once?" said she.  "Believe me, Prin
cess, I am ready to do all I can," answered Prince Vasili, "but it is difficult f
or me to ask the Emperor. I should advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Pri
nce Golitsyn. That would be the best way."  The elderly lady was a Princess Drube
tskaya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and ha
ving long been out of society had lost her former influential connections. She ha
d now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son
. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had obtained an invitati
on to Anna Pavlovna's reception and had sat listening to the vicomte's story. Pri
nce Vasili's words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome f
ace, but only for a moment then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasili's arm
 more tightly.  "Listen to me, Prince," said she. "I have never yet asked you for
 anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my father's fri
endship for you but now I entreat you for God's sake to do this for my sonand I s
hall always regard you as a benefactor," she added hurriedly. "No, don't be angry
, but promise! I have asked Golitsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man y
ou always were," she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.  "Papa,
 we shall be late," said Princess Helene, turning her beautiful head and looking 
over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door.  Influence
 in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last. P
rince Vasili knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of al
l who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary 
of using his influence. But in Princess Drubetskaya's case he felt, after her sec
ond appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was
 quite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career.
 Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those womenmostly moth
erswho, having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained the
ir end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour a
fter hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved him.  "My dear 
Anna Mikhaylovna," said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, "it 
is almost impossible for me to do what you ask but to prove my devotion to you an
d how I respect your father's memory, I will do the impossibleyour son shall be t
ransferred to the Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?"  "My dear be
nefactor! This is what I expected from youI knew your kindness!" He turned to go.
  "Waitjust a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards..." she faltered. 
"You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich Kutuzov... recommend Boris to hi
m as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then..."  Prince Vasili smiled.  "No,
 I won't promise that. You don't know how Kutuzov is pestered since his appointme
nt as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have cons
pired to give him all their sons as adjutants."  "No, but do promise! I won't let
 you go! My dear benefactor..."  "Papa," said his beautiful daughter in the same 
tone as before, "we shall be late."  "Well, au revoir! Goodby! You hear her?"  "T
hen tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?"  "Certainly but about Kutuzov, I don
't promise."  "Do promise, do promise, Vasili!" cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went
, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally 
to her, but was now very illsuited to her careworn face.  Apparently she had forg
otten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts. But as so
on as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression
. She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again preten
ded to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was accompl
ished.      CHAPTER V   "And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronat
ion at Milan?" asked Anna Pavlovna, "and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and
 Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte
 sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations? Adorable! It is e
nough to make one's head whirl! It is as if the whole world had gone crazy."  Pri
nce Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile.  "'D
ieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!' * They say he was very fine when he said 
that," he remarked, repeating the words in Italian "'Dio mi l'ha dato. Guai a chi
 la tocchi!'"        * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!   "
I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over," Anna Pav
lovna continued. "The sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a men
ace to everything."  "The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia," said the vicomte
, polite but hopeless "The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XV
II, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!" and he became more animated
. "And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon c
ause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper
."  And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.  Prince Hippolyte, w
ho had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette, suddenly t
urned completely round toward the little princess, and having asked for a needle 
began tracing the Conde coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with 
as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it.  "Baton de gueules, engrele de 
gueules d'azurmaison Conde," said he.  The princess listened, smiling.  "If Buona
parte remains on the throne of France a year longer," the vicomte continued, with
 the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone
 else, does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts, "th
ings will have gone too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, Frenc
h societyI mean good French societywill have been forever destroyed, and then..."
  He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to make a rem
ark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pavlovna, who had him under ob
servation, interrupted  "The Emperor Alexander," said she, with the melancholy wh
ich always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, "has declare
d that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form 
of government and I believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation wil
l certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king," she concluded, tryi
ng to be amiable to the royalist emigrant.  "That is doubtful," said Prince Andre
w. "Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too
 far. I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime."  "From what I ha
ve heard," said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the conversation, "almost all 
the aristocracy has already gone over to Bonaparte's side."  "It is the Buonapart
ists who say that," replied the vicomte without looking at Pierre. "At the presen
t time it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinion."  "Bonapa
rte has said so," remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile.  It was evident 
that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him, though withou
t looking at him.  "'I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,
'" Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon's words.
 "'I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.' I do not know how far he was ju
stified in saying so."  "Not in the least," replied the vicomte. "After the murde
r of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some peo
ple," he went on, turning to Anna Pavlovna, "he ever was a hero, after the murder
 of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth."  Bef
ore Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vico
mte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and though Anna Pavlovna
 felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.  "Th
e execution of the Duc d'Enghien," declared Monsieur Pierre, "was a political nec
essity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing 
to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed."  "Dieu! Mon Dieu!" mut
tered Anna Pavlovna in a terrified whisper.  "What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you con
sider that assassination shows greatness of soul?" said the little princess, smil
ing and drawing her work nearer to her.  "Oh! Oh!" exclaimed several voices.  "Ca
pital!" said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee with the pa
lm of his hand.  The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnl
y at his audience over his spectacles and continued.  "I say so," he continued de
sperately, "because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to a
narchy, and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for t
he general good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man's life."  "Won't
 you come over to the other table?" suggested Anna Pavlovna.  But Pierre continue
d his speech without heeding her.  "No," cried he, becoming more and more eager, 
"Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abu
ses, preserved all that was good in itequality of citizenship and freedom of spee
ch and of the pressand only for that reason did he obtain power."  "Yes, if havin
g obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored
 it to the rightful king, I should have called him a great man," remarked the vic
omte.  "He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might rid th
em of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man. The Revolution w
as a grand thing!" continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this desperate and pro
vocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in hi
s mind.  "What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But
 won't you come to this other table?" repeated Anna Pavlovna.  "Rousseau's Contra
t social," said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.  "I am not speaking of regicid
e, I am speaking about ideas."  "Yes ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide," aga
in interjected an ironical voice.  "Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are n
ot what is most important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation 
from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has re
tained in full force."  "Liberty and equality," said the vicomte contemptuously, 
as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words wer
e, "highsounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love libert
y and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have people since
 the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonapart
e has destroyed it."  Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre
 to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of Pie
rre's outburst Anna Pavlovna, despite her social experience, was horrorstruck. Bu
t when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, 
and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her for
ces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.  "But, my dear Mon
sieur Pierre," said she, "how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a 
ducor even an ordinary man whois innocent and untried?"  "I should like," said th
e vicomte, "to ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire was not that an impost
ure? It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!"  "And the
 prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!" said the little princess, shr
ugging her shoulders.  "He's a low fellow, say what you will," remarked Prince Hi
ppolyte.  Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His 
smile was unlike the halfsmile of other people. When he smiled, his grave, even r
ather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by anothera childlike, kindly, ev
en rather silly look, which seemed to ask forgiveness.  The vicomte who was meeti
ng him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not so terrible
 as his words suggested. All were silent.  "How do you expect him to answer you a
ll at once?" said Prince Andrew. "Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has 
to distinguish between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an empe
ror. So it seems to me."  "Yes, yes, of course!" Pierre chimed in, pleased at the
 arrival of this reinforcement.  "One must admit," continued Prince Andrew, "that
 Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaff
a where he gave his hand to the plaguestricken but... but there are other acts wh
ich it is difficult to justify."  Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone
 down the awkwardness of Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that 
it was time to go.  Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone
 to attend, and asking them all to be seated began  "I was told a charming Moscow
 story today and must treat you to it. Excuse me, VicomteI must tell it in Russia
n or the point will be lost...." And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in 
such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia. Ev
eryone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his s
tory.  "There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must hav
e two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her taste. And she
 had a lady's maid, also big. She said..."  Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evident
ly collecting his ideas with difficulty.  "She said... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' 
to the maid, 'put on a livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while
 I make some calls.'"  Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing lo
ng before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Sev
eral persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pavlovna, did however smile.  
"She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and her long ha
ir came down...." Here he could contain himself no longer and went on, between ga
sps of laughter "And the whole world knew...."  And so the anecdote ended. Though
 it was unintelligible why he had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, s
till Anna Pavlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's social tact in s
o agreeably ending Pierre's unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote
 the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next 
balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and where.      CHAPT
ER VI   Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began to
 take their leave.  Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, 
with huge red hands he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing roo
m and still less how to leave one that is, how to say something particularly agre
eable before going away. Besides this he was absentminded. When he rose to go, he
 took up instead of his own, the general's threecornered hat, and held it, pullin
g at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his absentmindednes
s and inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by his 
kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna Pavlovna turned toward him and, with 
a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and s
aid "I hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my d
ear Monsieur Pierre."  When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but a
gain everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, "Opinions are o
pinions, but you see what a capital, goodnatured fellow I am." And everyone, incl
uding Anna Pavlovna, felt this.  Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, t
urning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listen
ed indifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come in
to the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and s
tared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.  "Go in, Annette, or you will catch co
ld," said the little princess, taking leave of Anna Pavlovna. "It is settled," sh
e added in a low voice.  Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about
 the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess' sisterinlaw.
  "I rely on you, my dear," said Anna Pavlovna, also in a low tone. "Write to her
 and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au revoir!"and she left the 
hall.  Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face clos
e to her, began to whisper something.  Two footmen, the princess' and his own, st
ood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They lis
tened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of unde
rstanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual spoke smiling
ly and listened with a laugh.  "I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador's,"
 said Prince Hippolyte "so dull. It has been a delightful evening, has it not? De
lightful!"  "They say the ball will be very good," replied the princess, drawing 
up her downy little lip. "All the pretty women in society will be there."  "Not a
ll, for you will not be there not all," said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully an
d snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he even pushed aside, he began wrapp
ing it round the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally no one could 
have said which after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for 
a long time, as though embracing her.  Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, 
turning and glancing at her husband. Prince Andrew's eyes were closed, so weary a
nd sleepy did he seem.  "Are you ready?" he asked his wife, looking past her.  Pr
ince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion reached to
 his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch following the princ
ess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.  "Princesse, au revoir," cried
 he, stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet.  The princess, picking u
p her dress, was taking her seat in the dark carriage, her husband was adjusting 
his saber Prince Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone's way.  "A
llow me, sir," said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable tone to Prin
ce Hippolyte who was blocking his path.  "I am expecting you, Pierre," said the s
ame voice, but gently and affectionately.  The postilion started, the carriage wh
eels rattled. Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch wai
ting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home.  "Well, mon cher," said t
he vicomte, having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage, "your little 
princess is very nice, very nice indeed, quite French," and he kissed the tips of
 his fingers. Hippolyte burst out laughing.  "Do you know, you are a terrible cha
p for all your innocent airs," continued the vicomte. "I pity the poor husband, t
hat little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch."  Hippolyte spluttere
d again, and amid his laughter said, "And you were saying that the Russian ladies
 are not equal to the French? One has to know how to deal with them."   Pierre re
aching the house first went into Prince Andrew's study like one quite at home, an
d from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book
 that came to his hand it was Caesar's Commentaries, and resting on his elbow, be
gan reading it in the middle.  "What have you done to Mlle Scherer? She will be q
uite ill now," said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small whi
te hands.  Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eag
er face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.  "That abbe is very interes
ting but he does not see the thing in the right light.... In my opinion perpetual
 peace is possible butI do not know how to express it... not by a balance of poli
tical power...."  It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such ab
stract conversation.  "One can't everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, h
ave you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a diploma
tist?" asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.  Pierre sat up on the sofa,
 with his legs tucked under him.  "Really, I don't yet know. I don't like either 
the one or the other."  "But you must decide on something! Your father expects it
."  Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor, and had 
remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed
 the abbe and said to the young man, "Now go to Petersburg, look round, and choos
e your profession. I will agree to anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasili, a
nd here is money. Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything." P
ierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided on
 anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbe
d his forehead.  "But he must be a Freemason," said he, referring to the abbe who
m he had met that evening.  "That is all nonsense." Prince Andrew again interrupt
ed him, "let us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?"  "No, I have n
ot but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you. There is a war n
ow against Napoleon. If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and shoul
d be the first to enter the army but to help England and Austria against the grea
test man in the world is not right."  Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders a
t Pierre's childish words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to re
ply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other 
answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naive question.  "If no one fought
 except on his own conviction, there would be no wars," he said.  "And that would
 be splendid," said Pierre.  Prince Andrew smiled ironically.  "Very likely it wo
uld be splendid, but it will never come about..."  "Well, why are you going to th
e war?" asked Pierre.  "What for? I don't know. I must. Besides that I am going..
." He paused. "I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!"  
    CHAPTER VII   The rustle of a woman's dress was heard in the next room. Princ
e Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had 
in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa. The princ
ess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as t
he other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her.  "How is it," s
he began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair
, "how is it Annette never got married? How stupid you men all are not to have ma
rried her! Excuse me for saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an ar
gumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!"  "And I am still arguing with your 
husband. I can't understand why he wants to go to the war," replied Pierre, addre
ssing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men 
in their intercourse with young women.  The princess started. Evidently Pierre's 
words touched her to the quick.  "Ah, that is just what I tell him!" said she. "I
 don't understand it I don't in the least understand why men can't live without w
ars. How is it that we women don't want anything of the kind, don't need it? Now 
you shall judge between us. I always tell him Here he is Uncle's aidedecamp, a mo
st brilliant position. He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone. The 
other day at the Apraksins' I heard a lady asking, 'Is that the famous Prince And
rew?' I did indeed." She laughed. "He is so well received everywhere. He might ea
sily become aidedecamp to the Emperor. You know the Emperor spoke to him most gra
ciously. Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?"  P
ierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the conversation, g
ave no reply.  "When are you starting?" he asked.  "Oh, don't speak of his going,
 don't! I won't hear it spoken of," said the princess in the same petulantly play
ful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was s
o plainly illsuited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member. "To
day when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off..
. and then you know, Andre..." she looked significantly at her husband "I'm afrai
d, I'm afraid!" she whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.  Her husband look
ed at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was i
n the room, and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness.  "What is it you ar
e afraid of, Lise? I don't understand," said he.  "There, what egotists men all a
re all, all egotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he lea
ves me and locks me up alone in the country."  "With my father and sister, rememb
er," said Prince Andrew gently.  "Alone all the same, without my friends.... And 
he expects me not to be afraid."  Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up
, giving her not a joyful, but an animal, squirrellike expression. She paused as 
if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gis
t of the matter lay in that.  "I still can't understand what you are afraid of," 
said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.  The princess blushe
d, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.  "No, Andrew, I must say you ha
ve changed. Oh, how you have..."  "Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier," s
aid Prince Andrew. "You had better go."  The princess said nothing, but suddenly 
her short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and wal
ked about the room.  Pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise, now a
t him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.  "Why 
should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?" exclaimed the little princess suddenly
, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace. "I have long wanted
 to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You 
are going to the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?"  "Lise!" was all Prince
 Andrew said. But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all co
nviction that she would herself regret her words. But she went on hurriedly  "You
 treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave like that six 
months ago?"  "Lise, I beg you to desist," said Prince Andrew still more emphatic
ally.  Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all 
this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tea
rs and was ready to cry himself.  "Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you be
cause... I assure you I myself have experienced... and so... because... No, excus
e me! An outsider is out of place here... No, don't distress yourself... Goodby!"
  Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.  "No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too k
ind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you."  "No
, he thinks only of himself," muttered the princess without restraining her angry
 tears.  "Lise!" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which i
ndicates that patience is exhausted.  Suddenly the angry, squirrellike expression
 of the princess' pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. He
r beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband's face, and her own assumed the t
imid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its droopin
g tail.  "Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!" she muttered, and lifting her dress with one hand 
she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.  "Good night, Lise," s
aid he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a strang
er.      CHAPTER VIII   The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. 
Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead wit
h his small hand.  "Let us go and have supper," he said with a sigh, going to the
 door.  They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room. Eve
rything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore that imprint 
of newness found in the households of the newly married. Halfway through supper P
rince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation
 such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talkas one who has lo
ng had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out.  "Never, never
 marry, my dear fellow! That's my advice never marry till you can say to yourself
 that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the
 woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make 
a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothingor al
l that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Y
es! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anythin
g from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is en
ded, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side
 with a court lackey and an idiot!... But what's the good?..." and he waved his a
rm.  Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the g
oodnatured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in amazement. 
 "My wife," continued Prince Andrew, "is an excellent woman, one of those rare wo
men with whom a man's honor is safe but, O God, what would I not give now to be u
nmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because I like y
ou."  As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkonski who ha
d lolled in Anna Pavlovna's easy chairs and with halfclosed eyes had uttered Fren
ch phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering wit
h nervous excitement his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished,
 now flashed with brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seeme
d at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost mo
rbid irritation.  "You don't understand why I say this," he continued, "but it is
 the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career," said he though P
ierre had not mentioned Bonaparte, "but Bonaparte when he worked went step by ste
p toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, and he re
ached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose 
all freedom! And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and tor
ments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and trivialitythese 
are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war, the gre
atest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very am
iable and have a caustic wit," continued Prince Andrew, "and at Anna Pavlovna's t
hey listen to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and thos
e women... If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general! M
y father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everythingthat's what women 
are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seem
s as if there were something in them, but there's nothing, nothing, nothing! No, 
don't marry, my dear fellow don't marry!" concluded Prince Andrew.  "It seems fun
ny to me," said Pierre, "that you, you should consider yourself incapable and you
r life a spoiled life. You have everything before you, everything. And you..."  H
e did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he thought of his f
riend and how much he expected of him in the future.  "How can he talk like that?
" thought Pierre. He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince A
ndrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and 
which might be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished a
t Prince Andrew's calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, hi
s extensive reading he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion a
bout everything, but above all at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre 
was often struck by Andrew's lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to whi
ch he himself was particularly addicted, he regarded even this not as a defect bu
t as a sign of strength.  Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations 
of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wh
eels that they may run smoothly.  "My part is played out," said Prince Andrew. "W
hat's the use of talking about me? Let us talk about you," he added after a silen
ce, smiling at his reassuring thoughts.  That smile was immediately reflected on 
Pierre's face.  "But what is there to say about me?" said Pierre, his face relaxi
ng into a careless, merry smile. "What am I? An illegitimate son!" He suddenly bl
ushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this. "Wit
hout a name and without means... And it really..." But he did not say what "it re
ally" was. "For the present I am free and am all right. Only I haven't the least 
idea what I am to do I wanted to consult you seriously."  Prince Andrew looked ki
ndly at him, yet his glancefriendly and affectionate as it wasexpressed a sense o
f his own superiority.  "I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man
 among our whole set. Yes, you're all right! Choose what you will it's all the sa
me. You'll be all right anywhere. But look here give up visiting those Kuragins a
nd leading that sort of life. It suits you so badlyall this debauchery, dissipati
on, and the rest of it!"  "What would you have, my dear fellow?" answered Pierre,
 shrugging his shoulders. "Women, my dear fellow women!"  "I don't understand it,
" replied Prince Andrew. "Women who are comme il faut, that's a different matter 
but the Kuragins' set of women, 'women and wine' I don't understand!"  Pierre was
 staying at Prince Vasili Kuragin's and sharing the dissipated life of his son An
atole, the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew
's sister.  "Do you know?" said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought,
 "seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such a life I can't deci
de or think properly about anything. One's head aches, and one spends all one's m
oney. He asked me for tonight, but I won't go."  "You give me your word of honor 
not to go?"  "On my honor!"      CHAPTER IX   It was past one o'clock when Pierre
 left his friend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open
 cab intending to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the mo
re he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enou
gh to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or ev
ening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kuragin was expecting
 the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking
 bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.  "I should like t
o go to Kuragin's," thought he.  But he immediately recalled his promise to Princ
e Andrew not to go there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desire
d so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to tha
t he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to P
rince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised
 Prince Anatole to come to his gathering "besides," thought he, "all such 'words 
of honor' are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one con
siders that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen
 to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!" Pierre often indulged in r
eflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to 
Kuragin's.  Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards' barracks, in which An
atole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in a
t the open door. There was no one in the anteroom empty bottles, cloaks, and over
shoes were lying about there was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and sho
uting in the distance.  Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet 
dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were t
he remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly
 what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of laughter, the s
houting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some e
ight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others
 were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying to set h
im at the others.  "I bet a hundred on Stevens!" shouted one.  "Mind, no holding 
on!" cried another.  "I bet on Dolokhov!" cried a third. "Kuragin, you part our h
ands."  "There, leave Bruin alone here's a bet on."  "At one draught, or he loses
!" shouted a fourth.  "Jacob, bring a bottle!" shouted the host, a tall, handsome
 fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine li
nen shirt unfastened in front. "Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here is Petya! Good m
an!" cried he, addressing Pierre.  Another voice, from a man of medium height wit
h clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its so
ber ring, cried from the window "Come here part the bets!" This was Dolokhov, an 
officer of the Semenov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was living 
with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.  "I don't understand. Wha
t's it all about?"  "Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here," said Anatol
e, taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.  "First of all you must dr
ink!"  Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the 
tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to their cha
tter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre's glass while explaining that Dolokhov was
 betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of 
rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging ou
t.  "Go on, you must drink it all," said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, "
or I won't let you go!"  "No, I won't," said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and h
e went up to the window.  Dolokhov was holding the Englishman's hand and clearly 
and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to
 Anatole and Pierre.  Dolokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and lightblu
e eyes. He was about twentyfive. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, 
so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The l
ines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle of the upper lip for
med a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two
 distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth this, toge
ther with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect whi
ch made it impossible not to notice his face. Dolokhov was a man of small means a
nd no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dolokho
v lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them,
 including Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. Dolokhov co
uld play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank, he never lost hi
s clearheadedness. Both Kuragin and Dolokhov were at that time notorious among th
e rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.  The bottle of rum was brought. The window
 frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out
 by two footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions an
d shouts of the gentlemen around.  Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to t
he window. He wanted to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at th
e frame, but could not move it. He smashed a pane.  "You have a try, Hercules," s
aid he, turning to Pierre.  Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the
 oak frame out with a crash.  "Take it right out, or they'll think I'm holding on
," said Dolokhov.  "Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?" said Ana
tole.  "Firstrate," said Pierre, looking at Dolokhov, who with a bottle of rum in
 his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky, the dawn m
erging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.  Dolokhov, the bottle of rum st
ill in his hand, jumped onto the window sill. "Listen!" cried he, standing there 
and addressing those in the room. All were silent.  "I bet fifty imperials"he spo
ke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did, not speak it very
 well"I bet fifty imperials... or do you wish to make it a hundred?" added he, ad
dressing the Englishman.  "No, fifty," replied the latter.  "All right. Fifty imp
erials... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth
, sitting outside the window on this spot" he stooped and pointed to the sloping 
ledge outside the window "and without holding on to anything. Is that right?"  "Q
uite right," said the Englishman.  Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking hi
m by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at himthe Englishman was sho
rtbegan repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.  "Wait!" cried Dolokh
ov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention. "Wait a bi
t, Kuragin. Listen! If anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperi
als. Do you understand?"  The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether h
e intended to accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and thou
gh he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating Dolokh
ov's words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life Guards, who had 
been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill, leaned over, and looked dow
n.  "Oh! Oh! Oh!" he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of the 
pavement.  "Shut up!" cried Dolokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad j
umped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.  Placing the bottle 
on the window sill where he could reach it easily, Dolokhov climbed carefully and
 slowly through the window and lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of t
he window, he adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to 
the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candl
es and placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light. Dolokho
v's back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. Eve
ryone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but si
lent. One man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scar
ed and angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dolokhov's shirt.  "I say, this is 
folly! He'll be killed," said this more sensible man.  Anatole stopped him.  "Don
't touch him! You'll startle him and then he'll be killed. Eh?... What then?... E
h?"  Dolokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged himsel
f on his seat.  "If anyone comes meddling again," said he, emitting the words sep
arately through his thin compressed lips, "I will throw him down there. Now then!
"  Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lift
ed it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance himse
lf. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in t
hat position without taking his eyes from the window and from Dolokhov's back. An
atole stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing u
p his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room
 and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from
 which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and 
fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dolokhov still sat in 
the same position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touc
hed his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and highe
r and trembled with the effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising st
ill higher and his head tilting yet further back. "Why is it so long?" thought Pi
erre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dolokhov
 made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously this was
 sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he
 began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. One ha
nd moved as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre 
again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he wa
s aware of a stir all around. He looked up Dolokhov was standing on the window si
ll, with a pale but radiant face.  "It's empty."  He threw the bottle to the Engl
ishman, who caught it neatly. Dolokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.  "W
ell done!... Fine fellow!... There's a bet for you!... Devil take you!" came from
 different sides.  The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the m
oney. Dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the window si
ll.  "Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I'll do the same thing!" he suddenly 
cried. "Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a bottle. I'll do it....
 Bring a bottle!"  "Let him do it, let him do it," said Dolokhov, smiling.  "What
 next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go giddy even on a
 staircase," exclaimed several voices.  "I'll drink it! Let's have a bottle of ru
m!" shouted Pierre, banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and p
reparing to climb out of the window.  They seized him by his arms but he was so s
trong that everyone who touched him was sent flying.  "No, you'll never manage hi
m that way," said Anatole. "Wait a bit and I'll get round him.... Listen! I'll ta
ke your bet tomorrow, but now we are all going to 's."  "Come on then," cried Pie
rre. "Come on!... And we'll take Bruin with us."  And he caught the bear, took it
 in his arms, lifted it from the ground, and began dancing round the room with it
.      CHAPTER X   Prince Vasili kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubet
skaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Boris on the evening of Ann
a Pavlovna's soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, 
and Boris transferred into the regiment of Semenov Guards with the rank of cornet
. He received, however, no appointment to Kutuzov's staff despite all Anna Mikhay
lovna's endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pavlovna's reception Anna Mikha
ylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the Rostovs, w
ith whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Bory, who had only jus
t entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards 
as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time. The 
Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had r
emained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzivilov.
  It was St. Natalia's day and the name day of two of the Rostovsthe mother and t
he youngest daughterboth named Nataly. Ever since the morning, carriages with six
 horses had been coming and going continually, bringing visitors to the Countess 
Rostova's big house on the Povarskaya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess 
herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawingroom with the visitor
s who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays.  
The countess was a woman of about fortyfive, with a thin Oriental type of face, e
vidently worn out with childbearingshe had had twelve. A languor of motion and sp
eech, resulting from weakness, gave her a distinguished air which inspired respec
t. Princess Anna Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya, who as a member of the household was al
so seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The 
young people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to take
 part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw them off, invit
ing them all to dinner.  "I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher," or "ma cher
e"he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his
 tone, "my dear," whether they were above or below him in rank"I thank you for my
self and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping. But mind you come t
o dinner or I shall be offended, ma chere! On behalf of the whole family I beg yo
u to come, mon cher!" These words he repeated to everyone without exception or va
riation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, cleanshaven face, th
e same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As soon as he
 had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing
 room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and pu
tting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how 
to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, o
r touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad 
but selfconfident French then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulf
illment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray h
airs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back fr
om the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large 
marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people and looking
 at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfold
ing damask table linen, he would call Dmitri Vasilevich, a man of good family and
 the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous 
table would say "Well, Dmitri, you'll see that things are all as they should be? 
That's right! The great thing is the serving, that's it." And with a complacent s
igh he would return to the drawing room.  "Marya Lvovna Karagina and her daughter
!" announced the countess' gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawi
ng room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox wi
th her husband's portrait on it.  "I'm quite worn out by these callers. However, 
I'll see her and no more. She is so affected. Ask her in," she said to the footma
n in a sad voice, as if saying "Very well, finish me off."  A tall, stout, and pr
oudlooking woman, with a roundfaced smiling daughter, entered the drawing room, t
heir dresses rustling.  "Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor
 child... at the Razumovski's ball... and Countess Apraksina... I was so delighte
d..." came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and m
ingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs. Then one of thos
e conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise w
ith a rustle of dresses and say, "I am so delighted... Mamma's health... and Coun
tess Apraksina..." and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloak
s or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief topic of the day 
the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine's day, Count Bezukhov
, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at
 Anna Pavlovna's reception.  "I am so sorry for the poor count," said the visitor
. "He is in such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kil
l him!"  "What is that?" asked the countess as if she did not know what the visit
or alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count Bezukhov's d
istress some fifteen times.  "That's what comes of a modern education," exclaimed
 the visitor. "It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do
 as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things tha
t he has been expelled by the police."  "You don't say so!" replied the countess.
  "He chose his friends badly," interposed Anna Mikhaylovna. "Prince Vasili's son
, he, and a certain Dolokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows what!
 And they have had to suffer for it. Dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and 
Bezukhov's son sent back to Moscow. Anatole Kuragin's father managed somehow to g
et his son's affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg."  "But 
what have they been up to?" asked the countess.  "They are regular brigands, espe
cially Dolokhov," replied the visitor. "He is a son of Marya Ivanovna Dolokhova, 
such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewh
ere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The polic
e tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and th
e bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear
 swimming about with the policeman on his back!"  "What a nice figure the policem
an must have cut, my dear!" shouted the count, dying with laughter.  "Oh, how dre
adful! How can you laugh at it, Count?"  Yet the ladies themselves could not help
 laughing.  "It was all they could do to rescue the poor man," continued the visi
tor. "And to think it is Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov's son who amuses himself in
 this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and clever. This is
 all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no o
ne will receive him, in spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, b
ut I quite declined I have my daughters to consider."  "Why do you say this young
 man is so rich?" asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once as
sumed an air of inattention. "His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre a
lso is illegitimate."  The visitor made a gesture with her hand.  "I should think
 he has a score of them."  Princess Anna Mikhaylovna intervened in the conversati
on, evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in so
ciety.  "The fact of the matter is," said she significantly, and also in a half w
hisper, "everyone knows Count Cyril's reputation.... He has lost count of his chi
ldren, but this Pierre was his favorite."  "How handsome the old man still was on
ly a year ago!" remarked the countess. "I have never seen a handsomer man."  "He 
is very much altered now," said Anna Mikhaylovna. "Well, as I was saying, Prince 
Vasili is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very fond of Pierre, l
ooked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him so that in the case
 of his deathand he is so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has 
come from Petersburgno one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or 
Prince Vasili. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know it all very we
ll for Prince Vasili told me himself. Besides, Cyril Vladimirovich is my mother's
 second cousin. He's also my Bory's godfather," she added, as if she attached no 
importance at all to the fact.  "Prince Vasili arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hea
r he has come on some inspection business," remarked the visitor.  "Yes, but betw
een ourselves," said the princess, "that is a pretext. The fact is he has come to
 see Count Cyril Vladimirovich, hearing how ill he is."  "But do you know, my dea
r, that was a capital joke," said the count and seeing that the elder visitor was
 not listening, he turned to the young ladies. "I can just imagine what a funny f
igure that policeman cut!"  And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman
, his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who alw
ays eats well and, in particular, drinks well. "So do come and dine with us!" he 
said.      CHAPTER XI   Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smili
ng affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they 
now rose and took their leave. The visitor's daughter was already smoothing down 
her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room 
were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a
 chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her
 short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It wa
s evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in
 the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Gua
rds, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosyfaced boy in a short jacket.  The count j
umped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide and threw them roun
d the little girl who had run in.  "Ah, here she is!" he exclaimed laughing. "My 
pet, whose name day it is. My dear pet!"  "Ma chere, there is a time for everythi
ng," said the countess with feigned severity. "You spoil her, Ilya," she added, t
urning to her husband.  "How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of
 your name day," said the visitor. "What a charming child," she added, addressing
 the mother.  This blackeyed, widemouthed girl, not pretty but full of lifewith c
hildish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with blac
k curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lacefrilled drawers, and 
feet in low slipperswas just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a chil
d, though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to
 hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother's mantillanot paying the least a
ttention to her severe remarkand began to laugh. She laughed, and in fragmentary 
sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her 
frock.  "Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see..." was all Natasha managed to
 utter to her everything seemed funny. She leaned against her mother and burst in
to such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help
 joining in.  "Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you," said the mo
ther, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the visi
tor she added "She is my youngest girl."  Natasha, raising her face for a moment 
from her mother's mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and agai
n hid her face.  The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought 
it necessary to take some part in it.  "Tell me, my dear," said she to Natasha, "
is Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?"  Natasha did not like the vi
sitor's tone of condescension to childish things. She did not reply, but looked a
t her seriously.  Meanwhile the younger generation Boris, the officer, Anna Mikha
ylovna's son Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count's eldest son Sonya, the count
's fifteenyearold niece, and little Petya, his youngest boy, had all settled down
 in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of d
ecorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the b
ack rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had be
en more amusing than the drawingroom talk of society scandals, the weather, and C
ountess Apraksina. Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppr
ess their laughter.  The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from
 childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Bor
is was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate featur
es. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression. Dark hairs were al
ready showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enth
usiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to 
find something to say, but failed. Boris on the contrary at once found his footin
g, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she wa
s still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken how she had aged during th
e five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skul
l. Having said this he glanced at Natasha. She turned away from him and glanced a
t her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed l
aughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from 
the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. Boris did not laugh. 
 "You were meaning to go out, weren't you, Mamma? Do you want the carriage?" he a
sked his mother with a smile.  "Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready," she 
answered, returning his smile.  Boris quietly left the room and went in search of
 Natasha. The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program ha
d been disturbed.      CHAPTER XII   The only young people remaining in the drawi
ng room, not counting the young lady visitor and the countess' eldest daughter wh
o was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grownup person,
 were Nicholas and Sonya, the niece. Sonya was a slender little brunette with a t
ender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coili
ng twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the
 color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of he
r movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain
 coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, halfgrown kitten wh
ich promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it proper
 to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of hers
elf her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to jo
in the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for 
a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled
 down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon a
s they too could, like Natasha and Boris, escape from the drawing room.  "Ah yes,
 my dear," said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas, "his 
friend Boris has become an officer, and so for friendship's sake he is leaving th
e university and me, his old father, and entering the military service, my dear. 
And there was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! 
Isn't that friendship?" remarked the count in an inquiring tone.  "But they say t
hat war has been declared," replied the visitor.  "They've been saying so a long 
while," said the count, "and they'll say so again and again, and that will be the
 end of it. My dear, there's friendship for you," he repeated. "He's joining the 
hussars."  The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.  "It's not at al
l from friendship," declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning away as if from a s
hameful aspersion. "It is not from friendship at all I simply feel that the army 
is my vocation."  He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they we
re both regarding him with a smile of approbation.  "Schubert, the colonel of the
 Pavlograd Hussars, is dining with us today. He has been here on leave and is tak
ing Nicholas back with him. It can't be helped!" said the count, shrugging his sh
oulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.  "I hav
e already told you, Papa," said his son, "that if you don't wish to let me go, I'
ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army I am not a diplomat o
r a government clerk.I don't know how to hide what I feel." As he spoke he kept g
lancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady 
visitor.  The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment
 to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.  "All right, all ri
ght!" said the old count. "He always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all th
eir heads they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, 
well, God grant it," he added, not noticing his visitor's sarcastic smile.  The e
lders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karagina turned to young Rostov.  "Wha
t a pity you weren't at the Arkharovs' on Thursday. It was so dull without you," 
said she, giving him a tender smile.  The young man, flattered, sat down nearer t
o her with a coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential co
nversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the hea
rt of Sonya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glan
ced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to re
strain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and le
ft the room. All Nicholas' animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in t
he conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find Sonya.  "H
ow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves!" said Anna 
Mikhaylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out. "Cousinagedangereux voisinage" 
* she added.        * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.   "Yes," said the c
ountess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vani
shed and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mi
nd, "and how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we m
ight rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy.
 One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both fo
r girls and boys."  "It all depends on the bringing up," remarked the visitor.  "
Yes, you're quite right," continued the countess. "Till now I have always, thank 
God, been my children's friend and had their full confidence," said she, repeatin
g the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets 
from them. "I know I shall always be my daughters' first confidante, and that if 
Nicholas, with his impulsive nature, does get into mischief a boy can't help it, 
he will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men."  "Yes, they are s
plendid, splendid youngsters," chimed in the count, who always solved questions t
hat seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid. "Just fanc
y wants to be an hussar. What's one to do, my dear?"  "What a charming creature y
our younger girl is," said the visitor "a little volcano!"  "Yes, a regular volca
no," said the count. "Takes after me! And what a voice she has though she's my da
ughter, I tell the truth when I say she'll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We hav
e engaged an Italian to give her lessons."  "Isn't she too young? I have heard th
at it harms the voice to train it at that age."  "Oh no, not at all too young!" r
eplied the count. "Why, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen."  "
And she's in love with Boris already. Just fancy!" said the countess with a gentl
e smile, looking at Boris' and went on, evidently concerned with a thought that a
lways occupied her "Now you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it.
.. goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly" she meant that they would 
be kissing, "but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to
 me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her,
 but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter."  "Ye
s, I was brought up quite differently," remarked the handsome elder daughter, Cou
ntess Vera, with a smile.  But the smile did not enhance Vera's beauty as smiles 
generally do on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, 
expression. Vera was goodlooking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well 
brought up, and had a pleasant voice what she said was true and appropriate, yet,
 strange to say, everyonethe visitors and countess aliketurned to look at her as 
if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.  "People are always 
too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of th
em," said the visitor.  "What's the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countes
s was too clever with Vera," said the count. "Well, what of that? She's turned ou
t splendidly all the same," he added, winking at Vera.  The guests got up and too
k their leave, promising to return to dinner.  "What manners! I thought they woul
d never go," said the countess, when she had seen her guests out.      CHAPTER XI
II   When Natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conserv
atory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing ro
om, waiting for Boris to come out. She was already growing impatient, and stamped
 her foot, ready to cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young man's
 discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly. At this Natasha dashed sw
iftly among the flower tubs and hid there.  Boris paused in the middle of the roo
m, looked round, brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going 
up to a mirror examined his handsome face. Natasha, very still, peered out from h
er ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the gl
ass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Natasha was about to call him but 
changed her mind. "Let him look for me," thought she. Hardly had Boris gone than 
Sonya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, came in at the other door. Natas
ha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place,
 watchingas under an invisible capto see what went on in the world. She was exper
iencing a new and peculiar pleasure. Sonya, muttering to herself, kept looking ro
und toward the drawingroom door. It opened and Nicholas came in.  "Sonya, what is
 the matter with you? How can you?" said he, running up to her.  "It's nothing, n
othing leave me alone!" sobbed Sonya.  "Ah, I know what it is."  "Well, if you do
, so much the better, and you can go back to her!"  "Sooonya! Look here! How can 
you torture me and yourself like that, for a mere fancy?" said Nicholas taking he
r hand.  Sonya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natasha, not stirring a
nd scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes. "What will ha
ppen now?" thought she.  "Sonya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are
 everything!" said Nicholas. "And I will prove it to you."  "I don't like you to 
talk like that."  "Well, then, I won't only forgive me, Sonya!" He drew her to hi
m and kissed her.  "Oh, how nice," thought Natasha and when Sonya and Nicholas ha
d gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Boris to her.  "Boris, com
e here," said she with a sly and significant look. "I have something to tell you.
 Here, here!" and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs w
here she had been hiding.  Boris followed her, smiling.  "What is the something?"
 asked he.  She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown
 down on one of the tubs, picked it up.  "Kiss the doll," said she.  Boris looked
 attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not reply.  "Don't you want to
? Well, then, come here," said she, and went further in among the plants and thre
w down the doll. "Closer, closer!" she whispered.  She caught the young officer b
y his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face.  "And
 me? Would you like to kiss me?" she whispered almost inaudibly, glancing up at h
im from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from excitement.  Boris blush
ed.  "How funny you are!" he said, bending down to her and blushing still more, b
ut he waited and did nothing.  Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher tha
n he, embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck,
 and, tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.  Then she slipped down 
among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood, hanging her head.  
"Natasha," he said, "you know that I love you, but..."  "You are in love with me?
" Natasha broke in.  "Yes, I am, but please don't let us do like that.... In anot
her four years... then I will ask for your hand."  Natasha considered.  "Thirteen
, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen," she counted on her slender little fingers. "All ri
ght! Then it's settled?"  A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face. 
 "Settled!" replied Boris.  "Forever?" said the little girl. "Till death itself?"
  She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting
 room.      CHAPTER XIV   After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired
 that she gave orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to inv
ite to dinner all who came "to congratulate." The countess wished to have a tetea
tete talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikhaylovna, whom she h
ad not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg. Anna Mikhaylovna, with h
er tearworn but pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.  "W
ith you I will be quite frank," said Anna Mikhaylovna. "There are not many left o
f us old friends! That's why I so value your friendship."  Anna Mikhaylovna looke
d at Vera and paused. The countess pressed her friend's hand.  "Vera," she said t
o her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite, "how is it you have so li
ttle tact? Don't you see you are not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or..."  
The handsome Vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.  "If you ha
d told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone," she replied as she rose to go to her
 own room.  But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting, o
ne pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. Sonya was sitting clos
e to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the first he had ever writ
ten. Boris and Natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when Vera ente
red. Sonya and Natasha looked at Vera with guilty, happy faces.  It was pleasant 
and touching to see these little girls in love but apparently the sight of them r
oused no pleasant feeling in Vera.  "How often have I asked you not to take my th
ings?" she said. "You have a room of your own," and she took the inkstand from Ni
cholas.  "In a minute, in a minute," he said, dipping his pen.  "You always manag
e to do things at the wrong time," continued Vera. "You came rushing into the dra
wing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you."  Though what she said was quite 
just, perhaps for that very reason no one replied, and the four simply looked at 
one another. She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand.  "And at you
r age what secrets can there be between Natasha and Boris, or between you two? It
's all nonsense!"  "Now, Vera, what does it matter to you?" said Natasha in defen
se, speaking very gently.  She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affe
ctionate to everyone.  "Very silly," said Vera. "I am ashamed of you. Secrets ind
eed!"  "All have secrets of their own," answered Natasha, getting warmer. "We don
't interfere with you and Berg."  "I should think not," said Vera, "because there
 can never be anything wrong in my behavior. But I'll just tell Mamma how you are
 behaving with Boris."  "Natalya Ilynichna behaves very well to me," remarked Bor
is. "I have nothing to complain of."  "Don't, Boris! You are such a diplomat that
 it is really tiresome," said Natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly
. She used the word "diplomat," which was just then much in vogue among the child
ren, in the special sense they attached to it. "Why does she bother me?" And she 
added, turning to Vera, "You'll never understand it, because you've never loved a
nyone. You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more" this nickn
ame, bestowed on Vera by Nicholas, was considered very stinging, "and your greate
st pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much as you 
please," she finished quickly.  "I shall at any rate not run after a young man be
fore visitors..."  "Well, now you've done what you wanted," put in Nicholas"said 
unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let's go to the nursery."  All four
, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.  "The unpleasant things
 were said to me," remarked Vera, "I said none to anyone."  "Madame de Genlis! Ma
dame de Genlis!" shouted laughing voices through the door.  The handsome Vera, wh
o produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone, smiled and, evid
ently unmoved by what had been said to her, went to the looking glass and arrange
d her hair and scarf. Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still
 colder and calmer.   In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.  "
Ah, my dear," said the countess, "my life is not all roses either. Don't I know t
hat at the rate we are living our means won't last long? It's all the Club and hi
s easygoing nature. Even in the country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting,
 and heaven knows what besides! But don't let's talk about me tell me how you man
aged everything. I often wonder at you, Annettehow at your age you can rush off a
lone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people,
 and know how to deal with them all! It's quite astonishing. How did you get thin
gs settled? I couldn't possibly do it."  "Ah, my love," answered Anna Mikhaylovna
, "God grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with 
a son you love to distraction! One learns many things then," she added with a cer
tain pride. "That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those big peo
ple I write a note 'Princess SoandSo desires an interview with So andSo,' and the
n I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four timestill I get what I want. I d
on't mind what they think of me."  "Well, and to whom did you apply about Bory?" 
asked the countess. "You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my 
Nicholas is going as a cadet. There's no one to interest himself for him. To whom
 did you apply?"  "To Prince Vasili. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everyth
ing, and put the matter before the Emperor," said Princess Anna Mikhaylovna enthu
siastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end
.  "Has Prince Vasili aged much?" asked the countess. "I have not seen him since 
we acted together at the Rumyantsovs' theatricals. I expect he has forgotten me. 
He paid me attentions in those days," said the countess, with a smile.  "He is ju
st the same as ever," replied Anna Mikhaylovna, "overflowing with amiability. His
 position has not turned his head at all. He said to me, 'I am sorry I can do so 
little for you, dear Princess. I am at your command.' Yes, he is a fine fellow an
d a very kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son I would do anyth
ing for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is n
ow a terrible one," continued Anna Mikhaylovna, sadly, dropping her voice. "My wr
etched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress. Would you believe it, I ha
ve literally not a penny and don't know how to equip Boris." She took out her han
dkerchief and began to cry. "I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty
fiveruble note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladi
mirovich Bezukhov. If he will not assist his godsonyou know he is Bory's godfathe
rand allow him something for his maintenance, all my trouble will have been throw
n away.... I shall not be able to equip him."  The countess' eyes filled with tea
rs and she pondered in silence.  "I often think, though, perhaps it's a sin," sai
d the princess, "that here lives Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov so rich, all 
alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It's a burden to 
him, and Bory's life is only just beginning...."  "Surely he will leave something
 to Boris," said the countess.  "Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees 
are so selfish. Still, I will take Boris and go to see him at once, and I shall s
peak to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it's really all 
the same to me when my son's fate is at stake." The princess rose. "It's now two 
o'clock and you dine at four. There will just be time."  And like a practical Pet
ersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time, Anna Mikhaylovna sent someon
e to call her son, and went into the anteroom with him.  "Goodby, my dear," said 
she to the countess who saw her to the door, and added in a whisper so that her s
on should not hear, "Wish me good luck."  "Are you going to Count Cyril Vladimiro
vich, my dear?" said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom,
 and he added "If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the ho
use, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my dear. We w
ill see how Taras distinguishes himself today. He says Count Orlov never gave suc
h a dinner as ours will be!"      CHAPTER XV   "My dear Boris," said Princess Ann
a Mikhaylovna to her son as Countess Rostova's carriage in which they were seated
 drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count 
Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov's house. "My dear Boris," said the mother, drawing h
er hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son
's arm, "be affectionate and attentive to him. Count Cyril Vladimirovich is your 
godfather after all, your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be n
ice to him, as you so well know how to be."  "If only I knew that anything beside
s humiliation would come of it..." answered her son coldly. "But I have promised 
and will do it for your sake."  Although the hall porter saw someone's carriage s
tanding at the entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking
 to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of 
statues in niches and looking significantly at the lady's old cloak, he asked whe
ther they wanted the count or the princesses, and, hearing that they wished to se
e the count, said his excellency was worse today, and that his excellency was not
 receiving anyone.  "We may as well go back," said the son in French.  "My dear!"
 exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand on his arm as if that to
uch might soothe or rouse him.  Boris said no more, but looked inquiringly at his
 mother without taking off his cloak.  "My friend," said Anna Mikhaylovna in gent
le tones, addressing the hall porter, "I know Count Cyril Vladimirovich is very i
ll... that's why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my frie
nd... I only need see Prince Vasili Sergeevich he is staying here, is he not? Ple
ase announce me."  The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and
 turned away.  "Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich," he called 
to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallowtail coat, who ran dow
nstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.  The mother smoothed the folds 
of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her tro
ddendown shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs.  "My dear," she said to her 
son, once more stimulating him by a touch, "you promised me!"  The son, lowering 
his eyes, followed her quietly.  They entered the large hall, from which one of t
he doors led to the apartments assigned to Prince Vasili.  Just as the mother and
 son, having reached the middle of the hall, were about to ask their way of an el
derly footman who had sprung up as they entered, the bronze handle of one of the 
doors turned and Prince Vasili came outwearing a velvet coat with a single star o
n his breast, as was his custom when at hometaking leave of a goodlooking, darkha
ired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.  "Then it is certai
n?" said the prince.  "Prince, humanum est errare, * but..." replied the doctor, 
swallowing his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.        
* To err is human.   "Very well, very well..."  Seeing Anna Mikhaylovna and her s
on, Prince Vasili dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently an
d with a look of inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow s
uddenly clouded his mother's face, and he smiled slightly.  "Ah, Prince! In what 
sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our dear invalid?" said she, as thoug
h unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her.  Prince Vasili stared at her a
nd at Boris questioningly and perplexed. Boris bowed politely. Prince Vasili with
out acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikhaylovna, answering her query by a mo
vement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.  "Is it 
possible?" exclaimed Anna Mikhaylovna. "Oh, how awful! It is terrible to think...
. This is my son," she added, indicating Boris. "He wanted to thank you himself."
  Boris bowed again politely.  "Believe me, Prince, a mother's heart will never f
orget what you have done for us."  "I am glad I was able to do you a service, my 
dear Anna Mikhaylovna," said Prince Vasili, arranging his lace frill, and in tone
 and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an oblig
ation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg 
at Anna Scherer's reception.  "Try to serve well and show yourself worthy," added
 he, addressing Boris with severity. "I am glad.... Are you here on leave?" he we
nt on in his usual tone of indifference.  "I am awaiting orders to join my new re
giment, your excellency," replied Boris, betraying neither annoyance at the princ
e's brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quiet
ly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.  "Are you living
 with your mother?"  "I am living at Countess Rostova's," replied Boris, again ad
ding, "your excellency."  "That is, with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina
," said Anna Mikhaylovna.  "I know, I know," answered Prince Vasili in his monoto
nous voice. "I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that u
nlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too, I am told.
"  "But a very kind man, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylovna with a pathetic smile, as
 though she too knew that Count Rostov deserved this censure, but asked him not t
o be too hard on the poor old man. "What do the doctors say?" asked the princess 
after a pause, her worn face again expressing deep sorrow.  "They give little hop
e," replied the prince.  "And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his ki
ndness to me and Boris. He is his godson," she added, her tone suggesting that th
is fact ought to give Prince Vasili much satisfaction.  Prince Vasili became thou
ghtful and frowned. Anna Mikhaylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a r
ival for Count Bezukhov's fortune, and hastened to reassure him.  "If it were not
 for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle," said she, uttering the word wit
h peculiar assurance and unconcern, "I know his character noble, upright... but y
ou see he has no one with him except the young princesses.... They are still youn
g...." She bent her head and continued in a whisper "Has he performed his final d
uty, Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no worse, a
nd it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill. We women, Prince," 
and she smiled tenderly, "always know how to say these things. I absolutely must 
see him, however painful it may be for me. I am used to suffering."  Evidently th
e prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done at Anna Pavlovna's, 
that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna Mikhaylovna.  "Would not such a mee
ting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikhaylovna?" said he. "Let us wait until e
vening. The doctors are expecting a crisis."  "But one cannot delay, Prince, at s
uch a moment! Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful 
the duties of a Christian..."  A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of
 the princesses, the count's niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length o
f her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vasili turn
ed to her.  "Well, how is he?"  "Still the same but what can you expect, this noi
se..." said the princess, looking at Anna Mikhaylovna as at a stranger.  "Ah, my 
dear, I hardly knew you," said Anna Mikhaylovna with a happy smile, ambling light
ly up to the count's niece. "I have come, and am at your service to help you nurs
e my uncle. I imagine what you have gone through," and she sympathetically turned
 up her eyes.  The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the ro
om as Anna Mikhaylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had co
nquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasili to take a seat besid
e her.  "Boris," she said to her son with a smile, "I shall go in to see the coun
t, my uncle but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and don't forget 
to give him the Rostovs' invitation. They ask him to dinner. I suppose he won't g
o?" she continued, turning to the prince.  "On the contrary," replied the prince,
 who had plainly become depressed, "I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of
 that young man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him."  He sh
rugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Boris down one flight of stairs and up 
another, to Pierre's rooms.      CHAPTER XVI   Pierre, after all, had not managed
 to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there f
or riotous conduct and sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostov's
 was true. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been 
for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father's house. Though he
 expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and tha
t the ladies about his fatherwho were never favorably disposed toward himwould ha
ve used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arriv
al went to his father's part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the p
rincesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitti
ng at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was readi
ngthe one who had met Anna Mikhaylovna. The two younger ones were embroidering bo
th were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on h
er lip which made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse o
r a leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him w
ith frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expression while the yo
ungest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent
 over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw.
 She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from lau
ghing, stooped as if trying to make out the pattern.  "How do you do, cousin?" sa
id Pierre. "You don't recognize me?"  "I recognize you only too well, too well." 
 "How is the count? Can I see him?" asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabash
ed.  "The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have don
e your best to increase his mental sufferings."  "Can I see the count?" Pierre ag
ain asked.  "Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see hi
m... Olga, go and see whether Uncle's beef tea is readyit is almost time," she ad
ded, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father 
comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.  Ol
ga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and said "Then I w
ill go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see him."  And he left the ro
om, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole.  Next d
ay Prince Vasili had arrived and settled in the count's house. He sent for Pierre
 and said to him "My dear fellow, if you are going to behave here as you did in P
etersburg, you will end very badly that is all I have to say to you. The count is
 very, very ill, and you must not see him at all."  Since then Pierre had not bee
n disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs.  When Boris appea
red at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room, stopping occasionally at 
a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall, as if running a sword through an 
invisible foe, and glaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming 
his walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating. 
 "England is done for," said he, scowling and pointing his finger at someone unse
en. "Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man, is sentenced 
to..." But before Pierrewho at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in per
son and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and 
captured Londoncould pronounce Pitt's sentence, he saw a wellbuilt and handsome y
oung officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left Moscow when Boris was 
a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsive and he
arty way he took Boris by the hand with a friendly smile.  "Do you remember me?" 
asked Boris quietly with a pleasant smile. "I have come with my mother to see the
 count, but it seems he is not well."  "Yes, it seems he is ill. People are alway
s disturbing him," answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.  B
oris felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to 
introduce himself, and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked Pierre
 straight in the face.  "Count Rostov asks you to come to dinner today," said he,
 after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.  "Ah, Count Ros
tov!" exclaimed Pierre joyfully. "Then you are his son, Ilya? Only fancy, I didn'
t know you at first. Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame
 Jacquot?... It's such an age..."  "You are mistaken," said Boris deliberately, w
ith a bold and slightly sarcastic smile. "I am Boris, son of Princess Anna Mikhay
lovna Drubetskaya. Rostov, the father, is Ilya, and his son is Nicholas. I never 
knew any Madame Jacquot."  Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosqu
itoes or bees.  "Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I've mixed everything up. One
 has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Boris? Of course. Well, now we know 
where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition? The English will 
come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the Channel. I think the expedi
tion is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve doesn't make a mess of things!"  Boris
 knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition he did not read the papers and it was
 the first time he had heard Villeneuve's name.  "We here in Moscow are more occu
pied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics," said he in his quiet ir
onical tone. "I know nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is ch
iefly busy with gossip," he continued. "Just now they are talking about you and y
our father."  Pierre smiled in his goodnatured way as if afraid for his companion
's sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret. But Boris
 spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into Pierre's eyes.  "Mos
cow has nothing else to do but gossip," Boris went on. "Everybody is wondering to
 whom the count will leave his fortune, though he may perhaps outlive us all, as 
I sincerely hope he will..."  "Yes, it is all very horrid," interrupted Pierre, "
very horrid."  Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say 
something disconcerting to himself.  "And it must seem to you," said Boris flushi
ng slightly, but not changing his tone or attitude, "it must seem to you that eve
ryone is trying to get something out of the rich man?"  "So it does," thought Pie
rre.  "But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are quite mis
taken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are very poor, but for 
my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your father is rich, I don't re
gard myself as a relation of his, and neither I nor my mother would ever ask or t
ake anything from him."  For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he
 did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Boris under the elbow in his quick, clum
sy way, and, blushing far more than Boris, began to speak with a feeling of mingl
ed shame and vexation.  "Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could thi
nk?... I know very well..."  But Boris again interrupted him.  "I am glad I have 
spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You must excuse me," said he, putt
ing Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him, "but I hope I have not of
fended you. I always make it a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to tak
e? Will you come to dinner at the Rostovs'?"  And Boris, having apparently reliev
ed himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation an
d placed another in it, became quite pleasant again.  "No, but I say," said Pierr
e, calming down, "you are a wonderful fellow! What you have just said is good, ve
ry good. Of course you don't know me. We have not met for such a long time... not
 since we were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand
. I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but it's sp
lendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It's queer," he added afte
r a pause, "that you should have suspected me!" He began to laugh. "Well, what of
 it! I hope we'll get better acquainted," and he pressed Boris' hand. "Do you kno
w, I have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorr
y for him as a man, but what can one do?"  "And so you think Napoleon will manage
 to get an army across?" asked Boris with a smile.  Pierre saw that Boris wished 
to change the subject, and being of the same mind he began explaining the advanta
ges and disadvantages of the Boulogne expedition.  A footman came in to summon Bo
risthe princess was going. Pierre, in order to make Boris' better acquaintance, p
romised to come to dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately ove
r his spectacles into Boris' eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up a
nd down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his im
aginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant, intelligent, and 
resolute young man.  As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads
 a lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made u
p his mind that they would be friends.  Prince Vasili saw the princess off. She h
eld a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful.  "It is dreadful, dreadf
ul!" she was saying, "but cost me what it may I shall do my duty. I will come and
 spend the night. He must not be left like this. Every moment is precious. I can'
t think why his nieces put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prep
are him!... Adieu, Prince! May God support you..."  "Adieu, ma bonne," answered P
rince Vasili turning away from her.  "Oh, he is in a dreadful state," said the mo
ther to her son when they were in the carriage. "He hardly recognizes anybody."  
"I don't understand, Mammawhat is his attitude to Pierre?" asked the son.  "The w
ill will show that, my dear our fate also depends on it."  "But why do you expect
 that he will leave us anything?"  "Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poo
r!"  "Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma..."  "Oh, Heaven! How ill h
e is!" exclaimed the mother.      CHAPTER XVII   After Anna Mikhaylovna had drive
n off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov, Countess Rostova 
sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she 
rang.  "What is the matter with you, my dear?" she said crossly to the maid who k
ept her waiting some minutes. "Don't you wish to serve me? Then I'll find you ano
ther place."  The countess was upset by her friend's sorrow and humiliating pover
ty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always found e
xpression in calling her maid "my dear" and speaking to her with exaggerated poli
teness.  "I am very sorry, ma'am," answered the maid.  "Ask the count to come to 
me."  The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usu
al.  "Well, little countess? What a saute of game au madere we are to have, my de
ar! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Taras were not illspent. He is wo
rth it!"  He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling
 his gray hair.  "What are your commands, little countess?"  "You see, my dear...
 What's that mess?" she said, pointing to his waistcoat. "It's the saute, most li
kely," she added with a smile. "Well, you see, Count, I want some money."  Her fa
ce became sad.  "Oh, little countess!"... and the count began bustling to get out
 his pocketbook.  "I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles," and t
aking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband's waistcoat.  "Ye
s, immediately, immediately! Hey, who's there?" he called out in a tone only used
 by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons. "
Send Dmitri to me!"  Dmitri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the 
count's house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.  "Th
is is what I want, my dear fellow," said the count to the deferential young man w
ho had entered. "Bring me..." he reflected a moment, "yes, bring me seven hundred
 rubles, yes! But mind, don't bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time
, but nice clean ones for the countess."  "Yes, Dmitri, clean ones, please," said
 the countess, sighing deeply.  "When would you like them, your excellency?" aske
d Dmitri. "Allow me to inform you... But, don't be uneasy," he added, noticing th
at the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign
 of approaching anger. "I was forgetting... Do you wish it brought at once?"  "Ye
s, yes just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess."  "What a treasure that Dmitri
 is," added the count with a smile when the young man had departed. "There is nev
er any 'impossible' with him. That's a thing I hate! Everything is possible."  "A
h, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world," said the countes
s. "But I am in great need of this sum."  "You, my little countess, are a notorio
us spendthrift," said the count, and having kissed his wife's hand he went back t
o his study.  When Anna Mikhaylovna returned from Count Bezukhov's the money, all
 in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess' little tab
le, and Anna Mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating her.  "Well, my dea
r?" asked the countess.  "Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know 
him, he is so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word..."  "An
nette, for heaven's sake don't refuse me," the countess began, with a blush that 
looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and she took the money 
from under the handkerchief.  Anna Mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention an
d stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.  "This i
s for Boris from me, for his outfit."  Anna Mikhaylovna was already embracing her
 and weeping. The countess wept too. They wept because they were friends, and bec
ause they were kindhearted, and because theyfriends from childhoodhad to think ab
out such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over.... But those te
ars were pleasant to them both.      CHAPTER XVIII   Countess Rostova, with her d
aughters and a large number of guests, was already seated in the drawing room. Th
e count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection o
f Turkish pipes. From time to time he went out to ask "Hasn't she come yet?" They
 were expecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, known in society as le terrible dra
gon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for common sense and frank 
plainness of speech. Marya Dmitrievna was known to the Imperial family as well as
 to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed privately
 at her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less all with
out exception respected and feared her.  In the count's room, which was full of t
obacco smoke, they talked of war that had been announced in a manifesto, and abou
t the recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew it h
ad appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and ta
lking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head first to one side and t
hen to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the co
nversation of his two neighbors, whom he egged on against each other.  One of the
m was a sallow, cleanshaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face, already growi
ng old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man. He sat with his 
legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far
 into his mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. T
his was an old bachelor, Shinshin, a cousin of the countess', a man with "a sharp
 tongue" as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his com
panion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, b
rushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips 
gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. Thi
s was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semenov regiment with whom Boris was to 
travel to join the army, and about whom Natasha had, teased her elder sister Vera
, speaking of Berg as her "intended." The count sat between them and listened att
entively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was ver
y fond of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two loqu
acious talkers at one another.  "Well, then, old chap, mon tres honorable Alphons
e Karlovich," said Shinshin, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Rus
sian expressions with the choicest French phraseswhich was a peculiarity of his s
peech. "Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l'etat * you want to make somethin
g out of your company?"        * You expect to make an income out of the governme
nt.   "No, Peter Nikolaevich I only want to show that in the cavalry the advantag
es are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own position now, Peter Ni
kolaevich..."  Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His
 conversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calm and silent 
when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself. He coul
d remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or 
making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he
 would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.  "Consider m
y position, Peter Nikolaevich. Were I in the cavalry I should get not more than t
wo hundred rubles every four months, even with the rank of lieutenant but as it i
s I receive two hundred and thirty," said he, looking at Shinshin and the count w
ith a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must 
always be the chief desire of everyone else.  "Besides that, Peter Nikolaevich, b
y exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position," continued 
Berg, "and vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just thi
nk what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a li
ttle aside and to send something to my father," he went on, emitting a smoke ring
.  "La balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the proverb says
," remarked Shinshin, moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking 
at the count.         * So that squares matters.   The count burst out laughing. 
The other guests seeing that Shinshin was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivi
ous of irony or indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Gua
rds he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps how in wa
rtime the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company, mi
ght easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone in the regiment, 
and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all t
his, and did not seem to suspect that others, too, might have their own interests
. But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the naivete of his youthful egotism
 was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers.  "Well, my boy, you'll get along w
herever you gofoot or horsethat I'll warrant," said Shinshin, patting him on the 
shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.  Berg smiled joyously. The count, by h
is guests, went into the drawing room.  It was just the moment before a big dinne
r when the assembled guests, expecting the summons to zakuska, * avoid engaging i
n any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order t
o show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and hostess lo
ok toward the door, and now and then glance at one another, and the visitors try 
to guess from these glances who, or what, they are waiting forsome important rela
tion who has not yet arrived, or a dish that is not yet ready.        * Hors d'oe
uvres.   Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the midd
le of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across, blocking the way fo
r everyone. The countess tried to make him talk, but he went on naively looking a
round through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her que
stions in monosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one who did not notic
e the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with 
curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest fell
ow could have played such a prank on a policeman.  "You have only lately arrived?
" the countess asked him.  "Oui, madame," replied he, looking around him.  "You h
ave not yet seen my husband?"  "Non, madame." He smiled quite inappropriately.  "
You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it's very interesting."  "V
ery interesting."  The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhaylovna. The latt
er understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and sitting d
own beside him she began to speak about his father but he answered her, as he had
 the countess, only in monosyllables. The other guests were all conversing with o
ne another. "The Razumovskis... It was charming... You are very kind... Countess 
Apraksina..." was heard on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroo
m.  "Marya Dmitrievna?" came her voice from there.  "Herself," came the answer in
 a rough voice, and Marya Dmitrievna entered the room.  All the unmarried ladies 
and even the married ones except the very oldest rose. Marya Dmitrievna paused at
 the door. Tall and stout, holding high her fiftyyearold head with its gray curls
, she stood surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if r
olling them up. Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in Russian.  "Health and happiness 
to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children," she said, in her loud,
 fulltoned voice which drowned all others. "Well, you old sinner," she went on, t
urning to the count who was kissing her hand, "you're feeling dull in Moscow, I d
aresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just see
 how these nestlings are growing up," and she pointed to the girls. "You must loo
k for husbands for them whether you like it or not...."  "Well," said she, "how's
 my Cossack?" Marya Dmitrievna always called Natasha a Cossack and she stroked th
e child's arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. "I know she's a s
camp of a girl, but I like her."  She took a pair of pearshaped ruby earrings fro
m her huge reticule and, having given them to the rosy Natasha, who beamed with t
he pleasure of her saint'sday fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to 
Pierre.  "Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit," said she, assuming a soft high tone o
f voice. "Come here, my friend..." and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still 
higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacl
es.  "Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell your fa
ther the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it's my evident duty." She 
paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to follow, for this was clearly on
ly a prelude.  "A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathb
ed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame, sir, for 
shame! It would be better if you went to the war."  She turned away and gave her 
hand to the count, who could hardly keep from laughing.  "Well, I suppose it is t
ime we were at table?" said Marya Dmitrievna.  The count went in first with Marya
 Dmitrievna, the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of i
mportance to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came A
nna Mikhaylovna with Shinshin. Berg gave his arm to Vera. The smiling Julie Karag
ina went in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the whole d
ining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses followed singly
. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the galle
ry, and the guests settled down in their places. Then the strains of the count's 
household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of vi
sitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the counte
ss with Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna Mikhaylovna on her left, the other
 lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count, with the hussar
 colonel on his left and Shinshin and the other male visitors on his right. Midwa
y down the long table on one side sat the grownup young people Vera beside Berg, 
and Pierre beside Boris and on the other side, the children, tutors, and governes
ses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at
 his wife and her tall cap with its lightblue ribbons, and busily filled his neig
hbors' glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting he
r duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her 
husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than us
ual with his gray hair. At the ladies' end an even chatter of voices was heard al
l the time, at the men's end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially tha
t of the colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so 
much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with tende
r smiles was saying to Vera that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling. B
oris was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances
 with Natasha, who was sitting opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new
 faces, and ate a great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory pattie
s and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines. The
se latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behin
d the next man's shoulders and whispered "Dry Madeira"... "Hungarian"... or "Rhin
e wine" as the case might be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count
's monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank 
with enjoyment, gazing with everincreasing amiability at the other guests. Natash
a, who sat opposite, was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy th
ey are in love with and have just kissed for the first time. Sometimes that same 
look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl's look made him inclined t
o laugh without knowing why.  Nicholas sat at some distance from Sonya, beside Ju
lie Karagina, to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sonya
 wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turned pale
, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were s
aying to one another. The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing t
o resent any slight that might be put upon the children. The German tutor was try
ing to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a f
ull description of the dinner to his people in Germany and he felt greatly offend
ed when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, t
rying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because
 no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness 
that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge.      CHA
PTER XIX   At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. Th
e colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersbur
g and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been forwarded by cour
ier to the commander in chief.  "And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonapart
e?" remarked Shinshin. "He has stopped Austria's cackle and I fear it will be our
 turn next."  The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted 
to the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshin's remark.  "It is 
for the reasson, my goot sir," said he, speaking with a German accent, "for the r
easson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew 
wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze 
Empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances..." he spoke this last word with p
articular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.  Then with the unerrin
g official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of th
e manifesto  ... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor's sole and absolute 
aimto establish peace in Europe on firm foundationshas now decided him to despatc
h part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of tha
t purpose.  "Zat, my dear sir, is vy..." he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine
 with dignity and looking to the count for approval.  "Connaissezvous le Proverbe
 * 'Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but turn spindles at home!'?" said Shinshin, puc
kering his brows and smiling. "Cela nous convient a merveille.*2 Suvorov nowhe kn
ew what he was about yet they beat him a plate couture,*3 and where are we to fin
d Suvorovs now? Je vous demande un peu,"*4 said he, continually changing from Fre
nch to Russian.        *Do you know the proverb?       *2 That suits us down to t
he ground.       *3 Hollow.       *4 I just ask you that.   "Ve must vight to the
 last trrop of our plood!" said the colonel, thumping the table "and ve must tie 
for our Emperor, and zen all vill pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po
oossible"... he dwelt particularly on the word possible... "as pooossible," he en
ded, again turning to the count. "Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and zere'
s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you judge 
of it?" he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being d
iscussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel.  "
I am quite of your opinion," replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his plate roun
d and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as thoug
h he were at that moment facing some great danger. "I am convinced that we Russia
ns must die or conquer," he concluded, consciousas were othersafter the words wer
e uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion an
d were therefore awkward.  "What you said just now was splendid!" said his partne
r Julie.  Sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and dow
n to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.  Pierre listened to the 
colonel's speech and nodded approvingly.  "That's fine," said he.  "The young man
's a real hussar!" shouted the colonel, again thumping the table.  "What are you 
making such a noise about over there?" Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice suddenly inq
uired from the other end of the table. "What are you thumping the table for?" she
 demanded of the hussar, "and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the Fre
nch are here?"  "I am speaking ze truce," replied the hussar with a smile.  "It's
 all about the war," the count shouted down the table. "You know my son's going, 
Marya Dmitrievna? My son is going."  "I have four sons in the army but still I do
n't fret. It is all in God's hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you 
in a battle," replied Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice, which easily carried the who
le length of the table.  "That's true!"  Once more the conversations concentrated
, the ladies' at the one end and the men's at the other.  "You won't ask," Natash
a's little brother was saying "I know you won't ask!"  "I will," replied Natasha.
  Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half rose, b
y a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was coming, and t
urning to her mother  "Mamma!" rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish
 voice, audible the whole length of the table.  "What is it?" asked the countess,
 startled but seeing by her daughter's face that it was only mischief, she shook 
a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.  
The conversation was hushed.  "Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?" and Nata
sha's voice sounded still more firm and resolute.  The countess tried to frown, b
ut could not. Marya Dmitrievna shook her fat finger.  "Cossack!" she said threate
ningly.  Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the el
ders.  "You had better take care!" said the countess.  "Mamma! What sweets are we
 going to have?" Natasha again cried boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that he
r prank would be taken in good part.  Sonya and fat little Petya doubled up with 
laughter.  "You see! I have asked," whispered Natasha to her little brother and t
o Pierre, glancing at him again.  "Ice pudding, but you won't get any," said Mary
a Dmitrievna.  Natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved ev
en Marya Dmitrievna.  "Marya Dmitrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don't like i
ce cream."  "Carrot ices."  "No! What kind, Marya Dmitrievna? What kind?" she alm
ost screamed "I want to know!"  Marya Dmitrievna and the countess burst out laugh
ing, and all the guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Marya Dmitrievna's an
swer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dar
ed to treat Marya Dmitrievna in this fashion.  Natasha only desisted when she had
 been told that there would be pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was serv
ed round. The band again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests
, leaving their seats, went up to "congratulate" the countess, and reached across
 the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with one anoth
er. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in whic
h they had entered but with redder faces, the guests returned to the drawing room
 and to the count's study.      CHAPTER XX   The card tables were drawn out, sets
 made up for boston, and the count's visitors settled themselves, some in the two
 drawing rooms, some in the sitting room, some in the library.  The count, holdin
g his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual af
terdinner nap, and laughed at everything. The young people, at the countess' inst
igation, gathered round the clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played 
first. After she had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined 
the other young ladies in begging Natasha and Nicholas, who were noted for their 
musical talent, to sing something. Natasha, who was treated as though she were gr
own up, was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.  "What sh
all we sing?" she said.  "'The Brook,'" suggested Nicholas.  "Well, then, let's b
e quick. Boris, come here," said Natasha. "But where is Sonya?"  She looked round
 and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her.  Running int
o Sonya's room and not finding her there, Natasha ran to the nursery, but Sonya w
as not there either. Natasha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passa
ge. The chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female gen
eration in the Rostov household. And there in fact was Sonya lying face downward 
on Nurse's dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dr
ess under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsiv
ely that her bare little shoulders shook. Natasha's face, which had been so radia
ntly happy all that saint's day, suddenly changed her eyes became fixed, and then
 a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.  "Sony
a! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!" And Natasha's large mou
th widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began to wail like a baby without
 knowing why, except that Sonya was crying. Sonya tried to lift her head to answe
r but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the bed. Natasha wept, sitting 
on the bluestriped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort Sonya sat u
p and began wiping her eyes and explaining.  "Nicholas is going away in a week's 
time, his... papers... have come... he told me himself... but still I should not 
cry," and she showed a paper she held in her handwith the verses Nicholas had wri
tten, "still, I should not cry, but you can't... no one can understand... what a 
soul he has!"  And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.  "It'
s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and Boris also," she we
nt on, gaining a little strength "he is nice... there are no difficulties in your
 way.... But Nicholas is my cousin... one would have to... the Metropolitan himse
lf... and even then it can't be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma" Sonya look
ed upon the countess as her mother and called her so "that I am spoiling Nicholas
' career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God is my witness," and 
she made the sign of the cross, "I love her so much, and all of you, only Vera...
 And what for? What have I done to her? I am so grateful to you that I would will
ingly sacrifice everything, only I have nothing...."  Sonya could not continue, a
nd again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed. Natasha began consolin
g her, but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend's tr
ouble.  "Sonya," she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason of
 her friend's sorrow, "I'm sure Vera has said something to you since dinner? Hasn
't she?"  "Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and
 she found them on my table and said she'd show them to Mamma, and that I was ung
rateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me, but that he'll marry J
ulie. You see how he's been with her all day... Natasha, what have I done to dese
rve it?..."  And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natasha lifte
d her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting her.  "Son
ya, don't believe her, darling! Don't believe her! Do you remember how we and Nic
holas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room after supper? Why, we settled 
how everything was to be. I don't quite remember how, but don't you remember that
 it could all be arranged and how nice it all was? There's Uncle Shinshin's broth
er has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know. And Bo
ris says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about it. And he is s
o clever and so good!" said Natasha. "Don't you cry, Sonya, dear love, darling So
nya!" and she kissed her and laughed. "Vera's spiteful never mind her! And all wi
ll come right and she won't say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself
, and he doesn't care at all for Julie."  Natasha kissed her on the hair.  Sonya 
sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed ready to lift
 its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin playing with the ball of worsted
 as a kitten should.  "Do you think so?... Really? Truly?" she said, quickly smoo
thing her frock and hair.  "Really, truly!" answered Natasha, pushing in a crisp 
lock that had strayed from under her friend's plaits.  Both laughed.  "Well, let'
s go and sing 'The Brook.'"  "Come along!"  "Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat
 opposite me is so funny!" said Natasha, stopping suddenly. "I feel so happy!"  A
nd she set off at a run along the passage.  Sonya, shaking off some down which cl
ung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bon
y little chest, ran after Natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flu
shed face and light, joyous steps. At the visitors' request the young people sang
 the quartette, "The Brook," with which everyone was delighted. Then Nicholas san
g a song he had just learned      At nighttime in the moon's fair glow      How s
weet, as fancies wander free,    To feel that in this world there's one      Who 
still is thinking but of thee!     That while her fingers touch the harp      Waf
ting sweet music o'er the lea,    It is for thee thus swells her heart,      Sigh
ing its message out to thee...     A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,      But oh
! till then I cannot live!...   He had not finished the last verse before the you
ng people began to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the fee
t and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.   Pierre was sit
ting in the drawingroom where Shinshin had engaged him, as a man recently returne
d from abroad, in a political conversation in which several others joined but whi
ch bored Pierre. When the music began Natasha came in and walking straight up to 
Pierre said, laughing and blushing  "Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers
."  "I am afraid of mixing the figures," Pierre replied "but if you will be my te
acher..." And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl.  Whi
le the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up, Pierre sat 
down with his little partner. Natasha was perfectly happy she was dancing with a 
grownup man, who had been abroad. She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talk
ing to him like a grownup lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies 
had given her to hold. Assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows wh
en and where she had learned it she talked with her partner, fanning herself and 
smiling over the fan.  "Dear, dear! Just look at her!" exclaimed the countess as 
she crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natasha.  Natasha blushed and laughed.  "We
ll, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised at?"   In the mi
dst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the
 sitting room where the count and Marya Dmitrievna had been playing cards with th
e majority of the more distinguished and older visitors. They now, stretching the
mselves after sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entere
d the ballroom. First came Marya Dmitrievna and the count, both with merry counte
nances. The count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his be
nt arm to Marya Dmitrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit
 up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended, he clappe
d his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the firs
t violin  "Semen! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?"  This was the count's favorite 
dance, which he had danced in his youth. Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one
 figure of the anglaise.  "Look at Papa!" shouted Natasha to the whole company, a
nd quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grownup partner she bent her curl
y head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.  And indeed e
verybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman,
 who standing beside his tall and stout partner, Marya Dmitrievna, curved his arm
s, beat time, straightened his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with
 his foot, and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared 
the onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay strains of
 Daniel Cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance began to sound,
 all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfsthe m
en on one side and the women on the otherwho with beaming faces had come to see t
heir master making merry.  "Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!" loud
ly remarked the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.  The count danced wel
l and knew it. But his partner could not and did not want to dance well. Her enor
mous figure stood erect, her powerful arms hanging down she had handed her reticu
le to the countess, and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dan
ce. What was expressed by the whole of the count's plump figure, in Marya Dmitrie
vna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose. B
ut if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the spectato
rs by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he ca
pered about on his light feet, Marya Dmitrievna produced no less impression by sl
ight exertionsthe least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turnin
g, or stamp her footwhich everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual s
everity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could not attrac
t a moment's attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All
 were watching the count and Marya Dmitrievna. Natasha kept pulling everyone by s
leeve or dress, urging them to "look at Papa!" though as it was they never took t
heir eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deep
ly, waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster
 lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round Mary
a Dmitrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels until, turning his partner round 
to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft foot backwards, bowing h
is perspiring head, smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder 
of applause and laughter led by Natasha. Both partners stood still, breathing hea
vily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.  "That's how we use
d to dance in our time, ma chere," said the count.  "That was a Daniel Cooper!" e
xclaimed Marya Dmitrievna, tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily.      CHAPT
ER XXI   While in the Rostovs' ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced, to a
 tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and cooks w
ere getting the supper, Count Bezukhov had a sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced
 recovery impossible. After a mute confession, communion was administered to the 
dying man, preparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there
 was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, 
beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, w
aited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral. The Military
 Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aidesdecamp to inquire aft
er the count's health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the ce
lebrated grandee of Catherine's court, Count Bezukhov.  The magnificent reception
 room was crowded. Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor, hav
ing stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly ackn
owledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances
 fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince Vasili,
 who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the do
or, repeating something to him several times in low tones.  When the Military Gov
ernor had gone, Prince Vasili sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom, cros
sing one leg high over the other, leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his 
face with his hand. After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him 
with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor le
ading to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.  Those who we
re in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers, and, whenever anyon
e went into or came from the dying man's room, grew silent and gazed with eyes fu
ll of curiosity or expectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened.  "
The limits of human life... are fixed and may not be o'erpassed," said an old pri
est to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naively to his wo
rds.  "I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?" asked the lady, addin
g the priest's clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject
.  "Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament," replied the priest, passing his hand ove
r the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head.  "Who was t
hat? The Military Governor himself?" was being asked at the other side of the roo
m. "How younglooking he is!"  "Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no lon
ger recognizes anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction."  "I k
new someone who received that sacrament seven times."  The second princess had ju
st come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. 
Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leanin
g his elbow on a table.  "Beautiful," said the doctor in answer to a remark about
 the weather. "The weather is beautiful, Princess and besides, in Moscow one feel
s as if one were in the country."  "Yes, indeed," replied the princess with a sig
h. "So he may have something to drink?"  Lorrain considered.  "Has he taken his m
edicine?"  "Yes."  The doctor glanced at his watch.  "Take a glass of boiled wate
r and put a pinch of cream of tartar," and he indicated with his delicate fingers
 what he meant by a pinch.  "Dere has neffer been a gase," a German doctor was sa
ying to an aidedecamp, "dat one liffs after de sird stroke."  "And what a wellpre
served man he was!" remarked the aidedecamp. "And who will inherit his wealth?" h
e added in a whisper.  "It von't go begging," replied the German with a smile.  E
veryone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second princess went i
n with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain's instructions. The German
 doctor went up to Lorrain.  "Do you think he can last till morning?" asked the G
erman, addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.  Lorrain, pursing 
up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before his nose.  "Tonight, not lat
er," said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a decorous smile of selfsatis
faction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient's condition.   
Meanwhile Prince Vasili had opened the door into the princess' room.  In this roo
m it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there 
was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles. The room was crowded with sm
all pieces of furniture, whatnots, cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a h
igh, white feather bed was just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bar
k.  "Ah, is it you, cousin?"  She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual 
so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and cove
red with varnish.  "Has anything happened?" she asked. "I am so terrified."  "No,
 there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business, Catiche," * mutte
red the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated. "You h
ave made the place warm, I must say," he remarked. "Well, sit down let's have a t
alk."        *Catherine.   "I thought perhaps something had happened," she said w
ith her unchanging stonily severe expression and, sitting down opposite the princ
e, she prepared to listen.  "I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can't."  "W
ell, my dear?" said Prince Vasili, taking her hand and bending it downwards as wa
s his habit.  It was plain that this "well?" referred to much that they both unde
rstood without naming.  The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally 
long for her legs, looked directly at Prince Vasili with no sign of emotion in he
r prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a
 sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion, or of 
weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince Vasili understood it as an expr
ession of weariness.  "And I?" he said "do you think it is easier for me? I am as
 worn out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very
 serious talk."  Prince Vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervou
sly, now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression 
which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes too seemed strange a
t one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm.  
The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands, looked 
attentively into Prince Vasili's eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to b
reak silence, if she had to wait till morning.  "Well, you see, my dear princess 
and cousin, Catherine Semenovna," continued Prince Vasili, returning to his theme
, apparently not without an inner struggle "at such a moment as this one must thi
nk of everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you all, 
like children of my own, as you know."  The princess continued to look at him wit
hout moving, and with the same dull expression.  "And then of course my family ha
s also to be considered," Prince Vasili went on, testily pushing away a little ta
ble without looking at her. "You know, Catiche, that weyou three sisters, Mamonto
v, and my wifeare the count's only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is fo
r you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me but, my dear, I am
 getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything. Do you know I have sent 
for Pierre? The count," pointing to his portrait, "definitely demanded that he sh
ould be called."  Prince Vasili looked questioningly at the princess, but could n
ot make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was 
simply looking at him.  "There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon c
ousin," she replied, "and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow 
his noble soul peacefully to leave this..."  "Yes, yes, of course," interrupted P
rince Vasili impatiently, rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward h
im the little table that he had pushed away. "But... in short, the fact is... you
 know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his pr
operty, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre."  "He has made wills enough!" 
quietly remarked the princess. "But he cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre 
is illegitimate."  "But, my dear," said Prince Vasili suddenly, clutching the lit
tle table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly "what if a letter h
as been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre's legitimation?
 Do you understand that in consideration of the count's services, his request wou
ld be granted?..."  The princess smiled as people do who think they know more abo
ut the subject under discussion than those they are talking with.  "I can tell yo
u more," continued Prince Vasili, seizing her hand, "that letter was written, tho
ugh it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it. The only question is, has it bee
n destroyed or not? If not, then as soon as all is over," and Prince Vasili sighe
d to intimate what he meant by the words all is over, "and the count's papers are
 opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition w
ill certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son."  "An
d our share?" asked the princess smiling ironically, as if anything might happen,
 only not that.  "But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then 
be the legal heir to everything and you won't get anything. You must know, my dea
r, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have been destroyed
 or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you ought to know where they a
re, and must find them, because..."  "What next?" the princess interrupted, smili
ng sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes. "I am a woman, and y
ou think we are all stupid but I know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit... 
un batard!" * she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word would 
effectively prove to Prince Vasili the invalidity of his contention.        * A b
astard.   "Well, really, Catiche! Can't you understand! You are so intelligent, h
ow is it you don't see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begg
ing him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be Pie
rre but will become Count Bezukhov, and will then inherit everything under the wi
ll? And if the will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but 
the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s'ensuit! * That's certain.
"        * And all that follows therefrom.   "I know the will was made, but I als
o know that it is invalid and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool
," said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are 
saying something witty and stinging.  "My dear Princess Catherine Semenovna," beg
an Prince Vasili impatiently, "I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk a
bout your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I tell 
you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre's
 favor are among the count's papers, then, my dear girl, you and your sisters are
 not heiresses! If you don't believe me, then believe an expert. I have just been
 talking to Dmitri Onufrich" the family solicitor "and he says the same."  At thi
s a sudden change evidently took place in the princess' ideas her thin lips grew 
white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice when she began to speak pass
ed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect.  "That would
 be a fine thing!" said she. "I never wanted anything and I don't now."  She push
ed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.  "And this is gratitudethis
 is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake!" she cried
. "It's splendid! Fine! I don't want anything, Prince."  "Yes, but you are not th
e only one. There are your sisters..." replied Prince Vasili.  But the princess d
id not listen to him.  "Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I 
could expect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitudethe bla
ckest ingratitudein this house..."  "Do you or do you not know where that will is
?" insisted Prince Vasili, his cheeks twitching more than ever.  "Yes, I was a fo
ol! I still believed in people, loved them, and sacrificed myself. But only the b
ase, the vile succeed! I know who has been intriguing!"  The princess wished to r
ise, but the prince held her by the hand. She had the air of one who has suddenly
 lost faith in the whole human race. She gave her companion an angry glance.  "Th
ere is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was all done casu
ally in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards forgotten. Our duty, my
 dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last moments by not letting him com
mit this injustice, and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy t
hose who..."  "Who sacrificed everything for him," chimed in the princess, who wo
uld again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, "though he never cou
ld appreciate it. No, mon cousin," she added with a sigh, "I shall always remembe
r that in this world one must expect no reward, that in this world there is neith
er honor nor justice. In this world one has to be cunning and cruel."  "Now come,
 come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart."  "No, I have a wicked heart."
  "I know your heart," repeated the prince. "I value your friendship and wish you
 to have as good an opinion of me. Don't upset yourself, and let us talk sensibly
 while there is still time, be it a day or be it but an hour.... Tell me all you 
know about the will, and above all where it is. You must know. We will take it at
 once and show it to the count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to d
estroy it. You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his
 wishes that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him and you.
"  "Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguingI know!" cried the princess. 
 "That's not the point, my dear."  "It's that protege of yours, that sweet Prince
ss Drubetskaya, that Anna Mikhaylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... th
e infamous, vile woman!"  "Do not let us lose any time..."  "Ah, don't talk to me
! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile, disgrace
ful things about us, especially about SophieI can't repeat themthat it made the c
ount quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then 
he wrote this vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid."  "We've
 got to it at lastwhy did you not tell me about it sooner?"  "It's in the inlaid 
portfolio that he keeps under his pillow," said the princess, ignoring his questi
on. "Now I know! Yes if I have a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woma
n!" almost shrieked the princess, now quite changed. "And what does she come worm
ing herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time will co
me!"      CHAPTER XXII   While these conversations were going on in the reception
 room and the princess' room, a carriage containing Pierre who had been sent for 
and Anna Mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was driving into the
 court of Count Bezukhov's house. As the wheels rolled softly over the straw bene
ath the windows, Anna Mikhaylovna, having turned with words of comfort to her com
panion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himsel
f, Pierre followed Anna Mikhaylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to t
hink of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that th
ey had not come to the front entrance but to the back door. While he was getting 
down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly
 from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierr
e noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on
 both sides. But neither Anna Mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who c
ould not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. "It seems to be all r
ight," Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikhaylovna. She hurriedly ascended th
e narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to
 follow. Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at
 all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikhayl
ovna's air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely ne
cessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, car
rying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. These men pressed c
lose to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna pass and did not evince the l
east surprise at seeing them there.  "Is this the way to the princesses' apartmen
ts?" asked Anna Mikhaylovna of one of them.  "Yes," replied a footman in a bold l
oud voice, as if anything were now permissible "the door to the left, ma'am."  "P
erhaps the count did not ask for me," said Pierre when he reached the landing. "I
'd better go to my own room."  Anna Mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come
 up.  "Ah, my friend!" she said, touching his arm as she had done her son's when 
speaking to him that afternoon, "believe me I suffer no less than you do, but be 
a man!"  "But really, hadn't I better go away?" he asked, looking kindly at her o
ver his spectacles.  "Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been do
ne you. Think that he is your father... perhaps in the agony of death." She sighe
d. "I have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I s
hall not forget your interests."  Pierre did not understand a word, but the convi
ction that all this had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikhaylo
vna who was already opening a door.  This door led into a back anteroom. An old m
an, a servant of the princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had 
never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of th
ese rooms. Anna Mikhaylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decan
ter on a tray as "my dear" and "my sweet," asked about the princess' health and t
hen led Pierre along a stone passage. The first door on the left led into the pri
ncesses' apartments. The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the d
oor everything in the house was done in haste at that time, and Pierre and Anna M
ikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince Vasili an
d the eldest princess were sitting close together talking. Seeing them pass, Prin
ce Vasili drew back with obvious impatience, while the princess jumped up and wit
h a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might.  This action was 
so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on Prince Vasili's face so ou
t of keeping with his dignity that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over hi
s spectacles at his guide. Anna Mikhaylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled 
faintly and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had expected.  "B
e a man, my friend. I will look after your interests," said she in reply to his l
ook, and went still faster along the passage.  Pierre could not make out what it 
was all about, and still less what "watching over his interests" meant, but he de
cided that all these things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, d
imly lit room adjoining the count's reception room. It was one of those sumptuous
 but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in th
is room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet. 
They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe
 without heeding them. They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with
 two Italian windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full 
length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still sitting here i
n almost the same positions as before, whispering to one another. All became sile
nt and turned to look at the pale tearworn Anna Mikhaylovna as she entered, and a
t the big stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed her.  Ann
a Mikhaylovna's face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arriv
ed. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping Pierre close bes
ide her, entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon. She felt that as 
she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see, her own admission wa
s assured. Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count
's confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing
 yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing fir
st of one and then of another priest.  "God be thanked that you are in time," sai
d she to one of the priests "all we relatives have been in such anxiety. This you
ng man is the count's son," she added more softly. "What a terrible moment!"  Hav
ing said this she went up to the doctor.  "Dear doctor," said she, "this young ma
n is the count's son. Is there any hope?"  The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards
 and silently shrugged his shoulders. Anna Mikhaylovna with just the same movemen
t raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved awa
y from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and tenderly sa
d voice, she said  "Trust in His mercy!" and pointing out a small sofa for him to
 sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was watchi
ng and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.  Pierre, having mad
e up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved toward the sofa she had ind
icated. As soon as Anna Mikhaylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of a
ll in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He 
noticed that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with
 a kind of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before receiv
ed was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, ro
se and offered him her seat an aidedecamp picked up and returned a glove Pierre h
ad dropped the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, and moved to m
ake way for him. At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble
 the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors wh
o were not even in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do, and th
at tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which every
one expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their services. He
 took the glove in silence from the aidedecamp, and sat down in the lady's chair,
 placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an Eg
yptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that
 in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own i
deas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were gu
iding him.  Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasili with head erect majes
tically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three stars on his br
east. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning his eyes seemed larger th
an usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre. He went up to him, took his ha
nd a thing he never used to do, and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain 
whether it was firmly fixed on.  "Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to se
e you. That is well!" and he turned to go.  But Pierre thought it necessary to as
k "How is..." and hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call the d
ying man "the count," yet ashamed to call him "father."  "He had another stroke a
bout half an hour ago. Courage, my friend..."  Pierre's mind was in such a confus
ed state that the word "stroke" suggested to him a blow from something. He looked
 at Prince Vasili in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an atta
ck of illness. Prince Vasili said something to Lorrain in passing and went throug
h the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked 
at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and deacons and s
ome servants also went in at the door. Through that door was heard a noise of thi
ngs being moved about, and at last Anna Mikhaylovna, still with the same expressi
on, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre light
ly on the arm said  "The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be ad
ministered. Come."  Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and 
noticed that the strange lady, the aidedecamp, and some of the servants, all foll
owed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that ro
om.      CHAPTER XXIII   Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and 
an arch, its walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind t
he columns, with a high silkcurtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the ot
her an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated with red light lik
e a Russian church during evening service. Under the gleaming icons stood a long 
invalid chair, and in that chair on snowywhite smooth pillows, evidently freshly 
changed, Pierre sawcovered to the waist by a bright green quiltthe familiar, maje
stic figure of his father, Count Bezukhov, with that gray mane of hair above his 
broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically nobl
e wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay just under the icons his large thi
ck hands outside the quilt. Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, 
a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, ben
ding over from behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the prie
sts, their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments, with li
ghted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the service. A little
 behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes
, and just in front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and dete
rmined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though declaring to all that she coul
d not answer for herself should she glance round. Anna Mikhaylovna, with a meek, 
sorrowful, and allforgiving expression on her face, stood by the door near the st
range lady. Prince Vasili in front of the door, near the invalid chair, a wax tap
er in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chai
r he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself with his right ha
nd, turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead. His face wore a ca
lm look of piety and resignation to the will of God. "If you do not understand th
ese sentiments," he seemed to be saying, "so much the worse for you!"  Behind him
 stood the aidedecamp, the doctors, and the menservants the men and women had sep
arated as in church. All were silently crossing themselves, and the reading of th
e church service, the subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals 
sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mi
khaylovna, with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew wha
t she was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a
 taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him, began crossing h
imself with the hand that held the taper.  Sophie, the rosy, laughterloving, youn
gest princess with the mole, watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handker
chief, and remained with it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing Pierre s
he again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughin
g, but could not resist looking at him so to be out of temptation she slipped qui
etly behind one of the columns. In the midst of the service the voices of the pri
ests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the old servant who was 
holding the count's hand got up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikhaylovn
a stepped forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behi
nd her back. The French doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of the co
lumns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all dif
ferences of faith, understood the full importance of the rite now being performed
 and even approved of it. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step 
of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the gre
en quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflecte
d a moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir around hi
m, then the people resumed their places and the service continued. During this in
terval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasili left the chair on which he had been lean
ing, andwith an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others 
did not understand him it was so much the worse for themdid not go up to the dyin
g man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the s
ide of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leavin
g the bed both Prince Vasili and the princess passed out by a back door, but retu
rned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded. Pierre
 paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, havi
ng made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that eveni
ng was in some way essential.  The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice 
of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having recei
ved the sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around 
him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers, among which Anna Mikh
aylovna's was the most distinct.  Pierre heard her say  "Certainly he must be mov
ed onto the bed here it will be impossible..."  The sick man was so surrounded by
 doctors, princesses, and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddishyel
low face with its gray manewhich, though he saw other faces as well, he had not l
ost sight of for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the cauti
ous movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted t
he dying man and were moving him.  "Catch hold of my arm or you'll drop him!" he 
heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper. "Catch hold from underneat
h. Here!" exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers and t
he shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they were carrying
 were too much for them.  As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhaylovna, passed
 the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the
 dying man's high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by those
 who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly, leonine head. Th
is head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mou
th, and its cold, majestic expression, was not disfigured by the approach of deat
h. It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count ha
d sent him to Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneve
n movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing.
  After a few minutes' bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had carried the
 sick man dispersed. Anna Mikhaylovna touched Pierre's hand and said, "Come." Pie
rre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pos
e in keeping with the ceremony just completed. He lay with his head propped high 
on the pillows. His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the 
palms downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but wit
h a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man. Either 
this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere
, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and glanced inq
uiringly at his guide. Anna Mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glanci
ng at the sick man's hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre, ca
refully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her suggestion
 and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a sin
gle muscle of the count's face stirred. Once more Pierre looked questioningly at 
Anna Mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next. Anna Mikhaylovna with her eyes in
dicated a chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes a
sking if he were doing right. Anna Mikhaylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre f
ell into the naively symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed
 that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look
 as small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot where 
Pierre's face had been before he sat down. Anna Mikhaylovna indicated by her atti
tude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meetin
g between the father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seem
ed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count's face began to twi
tch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now d
id Pierre realize how near death his father was, and from that distorted mouth is
sued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick
 man's eyes, trying to guess what he wanted she pointed first to Pierre, then to 
some drink, then named Prince Vasili in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the
 quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to
 look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed.  "Wants to turn
 on the other side," whispered the servant, and got up to turn the count's heavy 
body toward the wall.  Pierre rose to help him.  While the count was being turned
 over, one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pul
l it forward. Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded th
at lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at
 any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre's terrorstricken face, and 
again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of 
keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own helplessness. At sight o
f this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in 
his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with 
his face to the wall. He sighed.  "He is dozing," said Anna Mikhaylovna, observin
g that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. "Let us go.
"  Pierre went out.      CHAPTER XXIV   There was now no one in the reception roo
m except Prince Vasili and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portra
it of Catherine the Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his
 companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide someth
ing as she whispered  "I can't bear the sight of that woman."  "Catiche has had t
ea served in the small drawing room," said Prince Vasili to Anna Mikhaylovna. "Go
 and take something, my poor Anna Mikhaylovna, or you will not hold out."  To Pie
rre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the should
er. Pierre went with Anna Mikhaylovna into the small drawing room.  "There is not
hing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea
," Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea
 from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold su
pper were laid in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count
 Bezukhov's house that night had gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre well reme
mbered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables. Durin
g balls given at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked sitti
ng in this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in their ball dre
sses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in th
e brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now
 this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea things a
nd supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the night a motley thron
g of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by
 every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and wha
t was about to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would
 very much have liked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she
 was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasil
i and the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and aft
er a short interval followed her. Anna Mikhaylovna was standing beside the prince
ss, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.  "Permit me, Princess, to kn
ow what is necessary and what is not necessary," said the younger of the two spea
kers, evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door 
of her room.  "But, my dear princess," answered Anna Mikhaylovna blandly but impr
essively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing, 
"won't this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose? Worldly 
conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared..."  Prince Vasili was
 seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with one leg crossed high abov
e the other. His cheeks, which were so flabby that they looked heavier below, wer
e twitching violently but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the t
wo ladies were saying.  "Come, my dear Anna Mikhaylovna, let Catiche do as she pl
eases. You know how fond the count is of her."  "I don't even know what is in thi
s paper," said the younger of the two ladies, addressing Prince Vasili and pointi
ng to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand. "All I know is that his real will
 is in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten...."  She tried to
 pass Anna Mikhaylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar her path.  "I know, my
 dear, kind princess," said Anna Mikhaylovna, seizing the portfolio so firmly tha
t it was plain she would not let go easily. "Dear princess, I beg and implore you
, have some pity on him! Je vous en conjure..."  The princess did not reply. Thei
r efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it 
was evident that if the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to 
Anna Mikhaylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none of i
ts honeyed firmness and softness.  "Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will n
ot be out of place in a family consultation is it not so, Prince?"  "Why don't yo
u speak, cousin?" suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawin
g room heard her and were startled. "Why do you remain silent when heaven knows w
ho permits herself to interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying 
man's room? Intriguer!" she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at th
e portfolio.  But Anna Mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on
 the portfolio, and changed her grip.  Prince Vasili rose. "Oh!" said he with rep
roach and surprise, "this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you."  The princess let 
go.  "And you too!"  But Anna Mikhaylovna did not obey him.  "Let go, I tell you!
 I will take the responsibility. I myself will go and ask him, I!... does that sa
tisfy you?"  "But, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylovna, "after such a solemn sacrament
, allow him a moment's peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion," said she, tu
rning to the young man who, having come quite close, was gazing with astonishment
 at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity, and at the twitchi
ng cheeks of Prince Vasili.  "Remember that you will answer for the consequences,
" said Prince Vasili severely. "You don't know what you are doing."  "Vile woman!
" shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna Mikhaylovna and snatching th
e portfolio from her.  Prince Vasili bent his head and spread out his hands.  At 
this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long and which had al
ways opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged against the wall, and the s
econd of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands.  "What are you doing!" 
she cried vehemently. "He is dying and you leave me alone with him!"  Her sister 
dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikhaylovna, stooping, quickly caught up the object o
f contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest princess and Prince Vasili, rec
overing themselves, followed her. A few minutes later the eldest sister came out 
with a pale hard face, again biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expressi
on showed an irrepressible hatred.  "Yes, now you may be glad!" said she "this is
 what you have been waiting for." And bursting into tears she hid her face in her
 handkerchief and rushed from the room.  Prince Vasili came next. He staggered to
 the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with
 his hand. Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as
 if in an ague.  "Ah, my friend!" said he, taking Pierre by the elbow and there w
as in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before. 
"How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am near sixty, dear f
riend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is awful..." and he burst int
o tears.  Anna Mikhaylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet 
steps.  "Pierre!" she said.  Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the yo
ung man on his forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said 
 "He is no more...."  Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.  "Come, I will go
 with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as tears."  She led him into th
e dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could see his face. Anna Mikhaylov
na left him, and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm.  
In the morning Anna Mikhaylovna said to Pierre  "Yes, my dear, this is a great lo
ss for us all, not to speak of you. But God will support you you are young, and a
re now, I hope, in command of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opene
d. I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it im
poses duties on you, and you must be a man."  Pierre was silent.  "Perhaps later 
on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there, God only knows what
 would have happened! You know, Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday n
ot to forget Boris. But he had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry ou
t your father's wish?"  Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly 
looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikhaylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna 
Mikhaylovna returned to the Rostovs' and went to bed. On waking in the morning sh
e told the Rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezukhov's deat
h. She said the count had died as she would herself wish to die, that his end was
 not only touching but edifying. As to the last meeting between father and son, i
t was so touching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not know 
which had behaved better during those awful momentsthe father who so remembered e
verything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or
 Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though h
e tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father. "It is painful, 
but it does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and hi
s worthy son," said she. Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vasili
 she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.      CHAPTER XX
V   At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andreevich Bolkonski's estate, the arrival of 
young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but this expectation did not
 upset the regular routine of life in the old prince's household. General in Chie
f Prince Nicholas Andreevich nicknamed in society, "the King of Prussia" ever sin
ce the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuo
usly with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne.
 Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continue
d to live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come 
the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and n
othing. He used to say that there are only two sources of human viceidleness and 
superstition, and only two virtuesactivity and intelligence. He himself undertook
 his daughter's education, and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave 
her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty, and arranged her life so
 that her whole time was occupied. He was himself always occupied writing his mem
oirs, solving problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, work
ing in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on at his
 estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity, regularity in 
his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude. He always came to t
able under precisely the same conditions, and not only at the same hour but at th
e same minute. With those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince w
as sharp and invariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he insp
ired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he
 was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high offi
cial appointed to the province in which the prince's estate lay considered it his
 duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gar
dener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed
 hour. Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respe
ct and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure
 of a rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gr
ay eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthf
ully glittering eyes.  On the morning of the day that the young couple were to ar
rive, Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for th
e morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent pray
er. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning prayed that the daily 
interview might pass off well.  An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the
 antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper "Please walk in."  Through the do
or came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly opened the door which mo
ved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the entrance. The prince was working at
 the lathe and after glancing round continued his work.  The enormous study was f
ull of things evidently in constant use. The large table covered with books and p
lans, the tall glassfronted bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for w
riting while standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with 
tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered aroundall indicated continuous, v
aried, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot e
mbroidered with silver, and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed tha
t the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. 
After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his
 chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching 
the table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing, so he si
mply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven and, regarding her tenderly and a
ttentively, said severely  "Quite well? All right then, sit down." He took the ex
ercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
 with his foot.  "For tomorrow!" said he, quickly finding the page and making a s
cratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.  The princess bent over 
the exercise book on the table.  "Wait a bit, here's a letter for you," said the 
old man suddenly, taking a letter addressed in a woman's hand from a bag hanging 
above the table, onto which he threw it.  At the sight of the letter red patches 
showed themselves on the princess' face. She took it quickly and bent her head ov
er it.  "From Heloise?" asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still 
sound, yellowish teeth.  "Yes, it's from Julie," replied the princess with a timi
d glance and a timid smile.  "I'll let two more letters pass, but the third I'll 
read," said the prince sternly "I'm afraid you write much nonsense. I'll read the
 third!"  "Read this if you like, Father," said the princess, blushing still more
 and holding out the letter.  "The third, I said the third!" cried the prince abr
uptly, pushing the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew towar
d him the exercise book containing geometrical figures.  "Well, madam," he began,
 stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of t
he chair on which she sat, so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by th
e acrid scent of old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. "Now, madam, t
hese triangles are equal please note that the angle ABC..."  The princess looked 
in a scared way at her father's eyes glittering close to her the red patches on h
er face came and went, and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so fr
ightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father's furthe
r explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the teacher's fault o
r the pupil's, this same thing happened every day the princess' eyes grew dim, sh
e could not see and could not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern 
father's withered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and coul
d think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem i
n peace. The old man was beside himself moved the chair on which he was sitting n
oisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself and not become vehem
ent, but almost always did become vehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exer
cise book away.  The princess gave a wrong answer.  "Well now, isn't she a fool!"
 shouted the prince, pushing the book aside and turning sharply away but rising i
mmediately, he paced up and down, lightly touched his daughter's hair and sat dow
n again.  He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.  "This won't do, Prince
ss it won't do," said he, when Princess Mary, having taken and closed the exercis
e book with the next day's lesson, was about to leave "Mathematics are most impor
tant, madam! I don't want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and y
ou'll like it," and he patted her cheek. "It will drive all the nonsense out of y
our head."  She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut
 book from the high desk.  "Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your H
eloise has sent you. Religious! I don't interfere with anyone's belief... I have 
looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go."  He patted her on the shoulder and hims
elf closed the door after her.  Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad,
 scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet
 plainer. She sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits a
nd which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as her fa
ther was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her l
etter. It was from her most intimate friend from childhood that same Julie Karagi
na who had been at the Rostovs' nameday party.  Julie wrote in French   Dear and 
precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is separation! Though I tell 
myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you, and that in
 spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds,
 my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions arou
nd me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever si
nce we parted. Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study,
 on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as three months ago, 
draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a loo
k I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write?   Having read thus far, P
rincess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right. It refl
ected a weak, ungraceful figure and thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked w
ith particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass. "She flatters me," th
ought the princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatte
r her friend, the princess' eyeslarge, deep and luminous it seemed as if at times
 there radiated from them shafts of warm lightwere so beautiful that very often i
n spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful th
an that of beauty. But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own
 eyesthe look they had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, he
r face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass. Sh
e went on reading   All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers i
s already abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march t
o the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought intends to
 expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant that the Corsican mo
nster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom i
t has pleased the Almighty, in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say noth
ing of my brothers, this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest m
y heart. I mean young Nicholas Rostov, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to 
remain inactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to y
ou, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was 
a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so no
bleminded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays amon
g our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank and has so much heart. 
He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him, transient as they were, have
 been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered s
o much. Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then. Tha
t is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know these poignant j
oys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger! I 
know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a frie
nd, but this sweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart 
needed. But enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is th
e death of old Count Bezukhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses h
ave received very little, Prince Vasili nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who ha
s inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate so tha
t he is now Count Bezukhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is r
umored that Prince Vasili played a very despicable part in this affair and that h
e returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.  I confess I understand very little a
bout all these matters of wills and inheritance but I do know that since this you
ng man, whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezuk
hov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to w
atch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable da
ughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though, between you and 
me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow. As for the past two years peopl
e have amused themselves by finding husbands for me most of whom I don't even kno
w, the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Be
zukhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post. A propos of 
marriages do you know that a while ago that universal auntie Anna Mikhaylovna tol
d me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you. It is neit
her more nor less than with Prince Vasili's son Anatole, whom they wish to reform
 by marrying him to someone rich and distinguee, and it is on you that his relati
ons' choice has fallen. I don't know what you will think of it, but I consider it
 my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very handsome and a terrible sca
pegrace. That is all I have been able to find out about him.  But enough of gossi
p. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and Mamma has sent for me to go a
nd dine at the Apraksins'. Read the mystical book I am sending you it has an enor
mous success here. Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human m
ind to grasp, it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! G
ive my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle Bourie
nne. I embrace you as I love you.  JULIE  P.S. Let me have news of your brother a
nd his charming little wife.   The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smi
le and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then s
he suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet 
of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote, also in
 French   Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great de
light. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which you say so m
uch that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect on you. You complain 
of our separation. What then should I say, if I dared complain, I who am deprived
 of all who are dear to me? Ah, if we had not religion to console us life would b
e very sad. Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for 
that young man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such f
eelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of them, neithe
r do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian love, love of one's neigh
bor, love of one's enemy, is worthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings whic
h the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young gi
rl like yourself.  The news of Count Bezukhov's death reached us before your lett
er and my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last represen
tative but one of the great century, and that it is his own turn now, but that he
 will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible. God preserve us fro
m that terrible misfortune!  I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as
 a child. He always seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the qual
ity I value most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince V
asili, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine Saviour's words, t
hat it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich ma
n to enter the Kingdom of God, are terribly true. I pity Prince Vasili but am sti
ll more sorry for Pierre. So young, and burdened with such richesto what temptati
ons he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be 
to be poorer than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the vol
ume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since you tell me 
that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding
 cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is uni
ntelligible and can therefore bear no fruit. I never could understand the fondnes
s some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that m
erely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for ex
aggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read the Epistle
s and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain for how c
an we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and holy secrets of Provi
dence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us a
nd the Eternal? Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules w
hich our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to confo
rm to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeb
le human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all knowledge th
at does not come from Him and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased
 to conceal from us, the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through Hi
s divine Spirit.  My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told m
e that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasili. In r
egard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet friend, tha
t I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform. However pa
inful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon
 me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without disquieting mysel
f by examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for husband.  I have ha
d a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival at Bald Hills with h
is wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one, however, for he will leave, us ag
ain to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn, God knows how
 or why. Not only where you areat the heart of affairs and of the worldis the tal
k all of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of naturewhich townsfolk cons
ider characteristic of the countryrumors of war are heard and painfully felt. My 
father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches, things of which I underst
and nothing and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village
 I witnessed a heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from
 our people and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of the 
mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should have heard the 
sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour, Wh
o preached love and forgiveness of injuriesand that men attribute the greatest me
rit to skill in killing one another.  Adieu, dear and kind friend may our divine 
Saviour and His most Holy Mother keep you in their holy and allpowerful care!  MA
RY   "Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched mine.
 I have written to my poor mother," said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapid
ly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r's. She brought into Princess
 Mary's strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, carel
ess, lighthearted, and selfsatisfied.  "Princess, I must warn you," she added, lo
wering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking w
ith exaggerated grasseyement, "the prince has been scolding Michael Ivanovich. He
 is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared."  "Ah, dear friend," replied P
rincess Mary, "I have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in. I 
do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do so."  The princess 
glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her p
ractice on the clavichord, went into the sitting room with a look of alarm. Betwe
en twelve and two o'clock, as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the p
rincess played the clavichord.      CHAPTER XXVI   The grayhaired valet was sitti
ng drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince, who was in his large study. F
rom the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficul
t passagestwenty times repeatedof a sonata by Dussek.  Just then a closed carriag
e and another with a hood drove up to the porch. Prince Andrew got out of the car
riage, helped his little wife to alight, and let her pass into the house before h
im. Old Tikhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, r
eported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door. T
ikhon knew that neither the son's arrival nor any other unusual event must be all
owed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince Andrew apparently knew thi
s as well as Tikhon he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father'
s habits had changed since he was at home last, and, having assured himself that 
they had not, he turned to his wife.  "He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us g
o across to Mary's room," he said.  The little princess had grown stouter during 
this time, but her eyes and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began t
o speak just as merrily and prettily as ever.  "Why, this is a palace!" she said 
to her husband, looking around with the expression with which people compliment t
heir host at a ball. "Let's come, quick, quick!" And with a glance round, she smi
led at Tikhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.  "Is that
 Mary practicing? Let's go quietly and take her by surprise."  Prince Andrew foll
owed her with a courteous but sad expression.  "You've grown older, Tikhon," he s
aid in passing to the old man, who kissed his hand.  Before they reached the room
 from which the sounds of the clavichord came, the pretty, fair haired Frenchwoma
n, Mademoiselle Bourienne, rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.  "A
h! what joy for the princess!" exclaimed she "At last! I must let her know."  "No
, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne," said the little princess, ki
ssing her. "I know you already through my sisterinlaw's friendship for you. She w
as not expecting us?"  They went up to the door of the sitting room from which ca
me the sound of the oftrepeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and 
made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.  The little princess entere
d the room. The passage broke off in the middle, a cry was heard, then Princess M
ary's heavy tread and the sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two pr
incesses, who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in e
ach other's arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to to
uch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart, with 
a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew sh
rugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers of music do when they hear a false no
te. The two women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late
, seized each other's hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began 
kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew's surprise both began t
o cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry. Prince Andrew e
vidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they
 should cry, and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been 
otherwise at this meeting.  "Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!" they suddenly exclaimed, 
and then laughed. "I dreamed last night...""You were not expecting us?..." "Ah! M
ary, you have got thinner?..." "And you have grown stouter!..."  "I knew the prin
cess at once," put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.  "And I had no idea!..." exclaimed 
Princess Mary. "Ah, Andrew, I did not see you."  Prince Andrew and his sister, ha
nd in hand, kissed one another, and he told her she was still the same crybaby as
 ever. Princess Mary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the lov
ing, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,
 rested on Prince Andrew's face.  The little princess talked incessantly, her sho
rt, downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when nec
essary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glitt
ering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had had on the Spass
ki Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition, and immediately a
fter that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that 
heaven knew what she would have to dress in here and that Andrew had quite change
d, and that Kitty Odyntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor f
or Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was st
ill looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and 
sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of he
r sisterinlaw's words. In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete 
she addressed her brother  "So you are really going to the war, Andrew?" she said
 sighing.  Lise sighed too.  "Yes, and even tomorrow," replied her brother.  "He 
is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had promotion..."  Princess
 Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of thought turned to he
r sisterinlaw with a tender glance at her figure.  "Is it certain?" she said.  Th
e face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said "Yes, quite certain. A
h! it is very dreadful..."  Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her 
sisterinlaw's and unexpectedly again began to cry.  "She needs rest," said Prince
 Andrew with a frown. "Don't you, Lise? Take her to your room and I'll go to Fath
er. How is he? Just the same?"  "Yes, just the same. Though I don't know what you
r opinion will be," answered the princess joyfully.  "And are the hours the same?
 And the walks in the avenues? And the lathe?" asked Prince Andrew with a scarcel
y perceptible smile which showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for h
is father, he was aware of his weaknesses.  "The hours are the same, and the lath
e, and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons," said Princess Mary gleefull
y, as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.  W
hen the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to ge
t up, Tikhon came to call the young prince to his father. The old man made a depa
rture from his usual routine in honor of his son's arrival he gave orders to admi
t him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dresse
d in oldfashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and when Princ
e Andrew entered his father's dressing room not with the contemptuous look and ma
nner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to
 Pierre, the old man was sitting on a large leathercovered chair, wrapped in a po
wdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tikhon.  "Ah! here's the warrior! Wants to
 vanquish Buonaparte?" said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the
 tail, which Tikhon was holding fast to plait, would allow.  "You at least must t
ackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this he'll soon have us, too, for 
his subjects! How are you?" And he held out his cheek.  The old man was in a good
 temper after his nap before dinner. He used to say that a nap "after dinner was 
silverbefore dinner, golden." He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from und
er his thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the 
spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father's favorite topicmaking fun 
of the military men of the day, and more particularly of Bonaparte.  "Yes, Father
, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant," said Prince Andrew, fo
llowing every movement of his father's face with an eager and respectful look. "H
ow is your health?"  "Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me I am bus
y from morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well."  "Thank God," 
said his son smiling.  "God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on," he continued
, returning to his hobby "tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonapa
rte by this new science you call 'strategy.'"  Prince Andrew smiled.  "Give me ti
me to collect my wits, Father," said he, with a smile that showed that his father
's foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him. "Why, I have not
 yet had time to settle down!"  "Nonsense, nonsense!" cried the old man, shaking 
his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. "
The house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and show her 
over, and they'll talk nineteen to the dozen. That's their woman's way! I am glad
 to have her. Sit down and talk. About Mikhelson's army I understandTolstoy's too
... a simultaneous expedition.... But what's the southern army to do? Prussia is 
neutral... I know that. What about Austria?" said he, rising from his chair and p
acing up and down the room followed by Tikhon, who ran after him, handing him dif
ferent articles of clothing. "What of Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?"  Pr
ince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, beganat first reluctantly, but grad
ually with more and more animation, and from habit changing unconsciously from Ru
ssian to French as he went onto explain the plan of operation for the coming camp
aign. He explained how an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia s
o as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war how part of tha
t army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund how two hundred and twenty th
ousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and 
on the Rhine how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Napl
es, and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French f
rom different sides. The old prince did not evince the least interest during this
 explanation, but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walk
ing about, and three times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouti
ng "The white one, the white one!"  This meant that Tikhon was not handing him th
e waistcoat he wanted. Another time he interrupted, saying  "And will she soon be
 confined?" and shaking his head reproachfully said "That's bad! Go on, go on."  
The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his description. The
 old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age "Malbrook s'en vaten guer
re. Dieu sait quand reviendra." *        * "Marlborough is going to the wars God 
knows when he'll      return."   His son only smiled.  "I don't say it's a plan I
 approve of," said the son "I am only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also f
ormed his plan by now, not worse than this one."  "Well, you've told me nothing n
ew," and the old man repeated, meditatively and rapidly  "Dieu sait quand reviend
ra. Go to the dining room."      CHAPTER XXVII   At the appointed hour the prince
, powdered and shaven, entered the dining room where his daughterinlaw, Princess 
Mary, and Mademoiselle Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his arch
itect, who by a strange caprice of his employer's was admitted to table though th
e position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have 
caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept very strictly to 
social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to hi
s table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivanovich who always went into a corne
r to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all 
men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Iva
novich was "not a whit worse than you or I." At dinner the prince usually spoke t
o the taciturn Michael Ivanovich more often than to anyone else.  In the dining r
oom, which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty, the members of 
the household and the footmenone behind each chairstood waiting for the prince to
 enter. The head butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, ma
king signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by w
hich the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, ne
w to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkonski, opposite whi
ch hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait evidently by the hand of
 the artist belonging to the estate of a ruling prince, in a crownan alleged desc
endant of Rurik and ancestor of the Bolkonskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at t
hat genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at a po
rtrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.  "How thoroughly like 
him that is!" he said to Princess Mary, who had come up to him.  Princess Mary lo
oked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand what he was laughing at. 
Everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question.  "
Everyone has his Achilles' heel," continued Prince Andrew. "Fancy, with his power
ful mind, indulging in such nonsense!"  Princess Mary could not understand the bo
ldness of her brother's criticism and was about to reply, when the expected foots
teps were heard coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily 
as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners wit
h the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock struck two an
d another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room. The prince stood st
ill his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly sca
nned all present and rested on the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do whe
n the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired i
n all around him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back o
f her neck.  "I'm glad, glad, to see you," he said, looking attentively into her 
eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. "Sit down, sit down! Sit d
own, Michael Ianovich!"  He indicated a place beside him to his daughterinlaw. A 
footman moved the chair for her.  "Ho, ho!" said the old man, casting his eyes on
 her rounded figure. "You've been in a hurry. That's bad!"  He laughed in his usu
al dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only and not with his eyes.  "You mus
t walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible," he said.  The little prin
cess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was silent and seemed confu
sed. The prince asked her about her father, and she began to smile and talk. He a
sked about mutual acquaintances, and she became still more animated and chattered
 away giving him greetings from various people and retailing the town gossip.  "C
ountess Apraksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes ou
t," she said, growing more and more lively.  As she became animated the prince lo
oked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her suffici
ently and had formed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael
 Ivanovich.  "Well, Michael Ivanovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of
 it. Prince Andrew" he always spoke thus of his son "has been telling me what for
ces are being collected against him! While you and I never thought much of him." 
 Michael Ivanovich did not at all know when "you and I" had said such things abou
t Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the p
rince's favorite topic, he looked inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what
 would follow.  "He is a great tactician!" said the prince to his son, pointing t
o the architect.  And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and
 the generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not only 
that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or
 of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy, successful 
only because there were no longer any Potemkins or Suvorovs left to oppose him bu
t he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and n
o real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playi
ng, pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father's r
idicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure
.  "The past always seems good," said he, "but did not Suvorov himself fall into 
a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to escape?"  "Who told 
you that? Who?" cried the prince. "Suvorov!" And he jerked away his plate, which 
Tikhon briskly caught. "Suvorov!... Consider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and
 Suvorov Moreau!... Moreau would have been a prisoner if Suvorov had had a free h
and but he had the HofskriegswurstschnappsRath on his hands. It would have puzzle
d the devil himself! When you get there you'll find out what those Hofskriegswurs
tRaths are! Suvorov couldn't manage them so what chance has Michael Kutuzov? No, 
my dear boy," he continued, "you and your generals won't get on against Buonapart
e you'll have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight togethe
r. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchm
an, Moreau," he said, alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to ente
r the Russian service.... "Wonderful!... Were the Potemkins, Suvorovs, and Orlovs
 Germans? No, lad, either you fellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived
 mine. May God help you, but we'll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a 
great commander among them! Hm!..."  "I don't at all say that all the plans are g
ood," said Prince Andrew, "I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You 
may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!"  "
Michael Ivanovich!" cried the old prince to the architect who, busy with his roas
t meat, hoped he had been forgotten "Didn't I tell you Buonaparte was a great tac
tician? Here, he says the same thing."  "To be sure, your excellency," replied th
e architect.  The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.  "Buonaparte was born wi
th a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got splendid soldiers. Besides he began by
 attacking Germans. And only idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the wo
rld began everybody has beaten the Germans. They beat no oneexcept one another. H
e made his reputation fighting them."  And the prince began explaining all the bl
unders which, according to him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in p
olitics. His son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments we
re presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He listen
ed, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this old man, living 
alone in the country for so many years, could know and discuss so minutely and ac
utely all the recent European military and political events.  "You think I'm an o
ld man and don't understand the present state of affairs?" concluded his father. 
"But it troubles me. I don't sleep at night. Come now, where has this great comma
nder of yours shown his skill?" he concluded.  "That would take too long to tell,
" answered the son.  "Well, then go to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, h
ere's another admirer of that powdermonkey emperor of yours," he exclaimed in exc
ellent French.  "You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!"  "Dieu sait quand rev
iendra..." hummed the prince out of tune and, with a laugh still more so, he quit
ted the table.  The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of t
he dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her fatherinlaw and 
now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she took her sisterinlaw's arm and
 drew her into another room.  "What a clever man your father is," said she "perha
ps that is why I am afraid of him."  "Oh, he is so kind!" answered Princess Mary.
      CHAPTER XXVIII   Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, n
ot altering his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was i
n her sisterinlaw's room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes ha
d been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him. After inspecting the 
carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnes
sed. Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room a small box, 
a large canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a sabera presen
t from his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochakov. All these traveli
ng effects of Prince Andrew's were in very good order new, clean, and in cloth co
vers carefully tied with tapes.  When starting on a journey or changing their mod
e of life, men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At
 such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew's face
 looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced briskly fr
om corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him and thoughtfully sha
king his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his wife?pe
rhaps both, but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing fo
otsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if
 tying the cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrabl
e expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.  "I hear you
 have given orders to harness," she cried, panting she had apparently been runnin
g, "and I did so wish to have another talk with you alone! God knows how long we 
may again be parted. You are not angry with me for coming? You have changed so, A
ndrusha," she added, as if to explain such a question.  She smiled as she uttered
 his pet name, "Andrusha." It was obviously strange to her to think that this ste
rn handsome man should be Andrushathe slender mischievous boy who had been her pl
ayfellow in childhood.  "And where is Lise?" he asked, answering her question onl
y by a smile.  "She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my roo
m. Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have," said she, sitting down on the
 sofa, facing her brother. "She is quite a child such a dear, merry child. I have
 grown so fond of her."  Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the i
ronical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.  "One must be indul
gent to little weaknesses who is free from them, Andrew? Don't forget that she ha
s grown up and been educated in society, and so her position now is not a rosy on
e. We should enter into everyone's situation. Tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonn
er. * Think what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to,
 to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her condition
! It's very hard."        * To understand all is to forgive all.   Prince Andrew 
smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we think we thoroughly un
derstand.  "You live in the country and don't think the life terrible," he replie
d.  "I... that's different. Why speak of me? I don't want any other life, and can
't, for I know no other. But think, Andrew for a young society woman to be buried
 in the country during the best years of her life, all alonefor Papa is always bu
sy, and I... well, you know what poor resources I have for entertaining a woman u
sed to the best society. There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne...."  "I don't like
 your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all," said Prince Andrew.  "No? She is very nice 
and kind and, above all, she's much to be pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell
 the truth, I don't need her, and she's even in my way. You know I always was a s
avage, and now am even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much
. She and Michael Ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and ki
nd, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says 'We don't love 
people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.
' Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father. She is very 
goodnatured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the even
ings and reads splendidly."  "To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father's characte
r sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn't it?" Prince Andrew asked suddenl
y.  Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.  "For me?
 For me?... Trying for me!..." said she.  "He always was rather harsh and now I s
hould think he's getting very trying," said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking li
ghtly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister.  "You are good in ev
ery way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride," said the princess, f
ollowing the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation"
and that's a great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what fee
ling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented
 and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I am."  Her brother sho
ok his head incredulously.  "The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell yo
u the truth, Andrew... is Father's way of treating religious subjects. I don't un
derstand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as d
ay, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing that makes me unhappy. But e
ven in this I can see lately a shade of improvement. His satire has been less bit
ter of late, and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with."  "Ah! my
 dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder," said Prince Andrew
 banteringly yet tenderly.  "Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hea
r me. Andrew..." she said timidly after a moment's silence, "I have a great favor
 to ask of you."  "What is it, dear?"  "Nopromise that you will not refuse! It wi
ll give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Pr
omise, Andrusha!..." said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet takin
g out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were the subject of her
 request and must not be shown before the request was granted.  She looked timidl
y at her brother.  "Even if it were a great deal of trouble..." answered Prince A
ndrew, as if guessing what it was about.  "Think what you please! I know you are 
just like Father. Think as you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father
's father, our grandfather, wore it in all his wars." She still did not take out 
what she was holding in her reticule. "So you promise?"  "Of course. What is it?"
  "Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take
 it off. Do you promise?"  "If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won't break 
my neck... To please you..." said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the pa
ined expression his joke had brought to his sister's face, he repented and added 
"I am glad really, dear, I am very glad."  "Against your will He will save and ha
ve mercy on you and bring you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace," s
aid she in a voice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands befo
re her brother a small, oval, antique, darkfaced icon of the Saviour in a gold se
tting, on a finely wrought silver chain.  She crossed herself, kissed the icon, a
nd handed it to Andrew.  "Please, Andrew, for my sake!..."  Rays of gentle light 
shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin, sickly
 face and made it beautiful. Her brother would have taken the icon, but she stopp
ed him. Andrew understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look 
of tenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.  "Thank
 you, my dear." She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa. Th
ey were silent for a while.  "As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generou
s as you always used to be. Don't judge Lise harshly," she began. "She is so swee
t, so goodnatured, and her position now is a very hard one."  "I do not think I h
ave complained of my wife to you, Masha, or blamed her. Why do you say all this t
o me?"  Red patches appeared on Princess Mary's face and she was silent as if she
 felt guilty.  "I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. 
And I am sorry for that," he went on.  The patches grew deeper on her forehead, n
eck, and cheeks. She tried to say something but could not. Her brother had guesse
d right the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her fo
rebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of he
r fate, her fatherinlaw, and her husband. After crying she had fallen asleep. Pri
nce Andrew felt sorry for his sister.  "Know this, Masha I can't reproach, have n
ot reproached, and never shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot repro
ach myself with anything in regard to her and that always will be so in whatever 
circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if you want t
o know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this is so I don't know.
.."  As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed her foreh
ead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccustomed brightness,
 but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of th
e open doorway.  "Let us go to her, I must say goodby. Orgo and wake and I'll com
e in a moment. Petrushka!" he called to his valet "Come here, take these away. Pu
t this on the seat and this to the right."  Princess Mary rose and moved to the d
oor, then stopped and said "Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God
 and asked Him to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have b
een answered."  "Well, may be!" said Prince Andrew. "Go, Masha I'll come immediat
ely."  On the way to his sister's room, in the passage which connected one wing w
ith the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling sweetly. It was t
he third time that day that, with an ecstatic and artless smile, she had met him 
in secluded passages.  "Oh! I thought you were in your room," she said, for some 
reason blushing and dropping her eyes.  Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and a
n expression of anger suddenly came over his face. He said nothing to her but loo
ked at her forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt tha
t the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his siste
r's room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying one word after 
another, came through the open door. She was speaking as usual in French, and as 
if after long selfrestraint she wished to make up for lost time.  "No, but imagin
e the old Countess Zubova, with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth, as
 if she were trying to cheat old age.... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!"  This very sentence a
bout Countess Zubova and this same laugh Prince Andrew had already heard from his
 wife in the presence of others some five times. He entered the room softly. The 
little princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in he
r hands, talking incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases
. Prince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after the
ir journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.  The coach with six horse
s was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn night, so dark that the coachman cou
ld not see the carriage pole. Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the p
orch. The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windo
ws. The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid goodby to the yo
ung prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall 
Michael Ivanovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary, and the little princess
. Prince Andrew had been called to his father's study as the latter wished to say
 goodby to him alone. All were waiting for them to come out.  When Prince Andrew 
entered the study the old man in his oldage spectacles and white dressing gown, i
n which he received no one but his son, sat at the table writing. He glanced roun
d.  "Going?" And he went on writing.  "I've come to say goodby."  "Kiss me here,"
 and he touched his cheek "Thanks, thanks!"  "What do you thank me for?"  "For no
t dillydallying and not hanging to a woman's apron strings. The Service before ev
erything. Thanks, thanks!" And he went on writing, so that his quill spluttered a
nd squeaked. "If you have anything to say, say it. These two things can be done t
ogether," he added.  "About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your
 hands..."  "Why talk nonsense? Say what you want."  "When her confinement is due
, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let him be here...."  The old prince stopp
ed writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his stern eyes on his son.  "I kno
w that no one can help if nature does not do her work," said Prince Andrew, evide
ntly confused. "I know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong, but it is
 her fancy and mine. They have been telling her things. She has had a dream and i
s frightened."  "Hm... Hm..." muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what 
he was writing. "I'll do it."  He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to 
his son began to laugh.  "It's a bad business, eh?"  "What is bad, Father?"  "The
 wife!" said the old prince, briefly and significantly.  "I don't understand!" sa
id Prince Andrew.  "No, it can't be helped, lad," said the prince. "They're all l
ike that one can't unmarry. Don't be afraid I won't tell anyone, but you know it 
yourself."  He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, look
ed straight into his son's face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him, a
nd again laughed his frigid laugh.  The son sighed, thus admitting that his fathe
r had understood him. The old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatchin
g up and throwing down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapi
dity.  "What's to be done? She's pretty! I will do everything. Make your mind eas
y," said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.  Andrew did not speak h
e was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him. The old man got
 up and gave the letter to his son.  "Listen!" said he "don't worry about your wi
fe what can be done shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilarionovic
h. * I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep 
you long as an adjutant a bad position! Tell him I remember and like him. Write a
nd tell me how he receives you. If he is all rightserve him. Nicholas Bolkonski's
 son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here."        *Ku
tuzov.   He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son w
as accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the lid, drew out
 a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his bold, tall, close handwr
iting.  "I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs hand 
them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond and a letter it is
 a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvorov's wars. Send it to the Aca
demy. Here are some jottings for you to read when I am gone. You will find them u
seful."  Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time y
et. He felt that he must not say it.  "I will do it all, Father," he said.  "Well
, now, goodby!" He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced him. "Remember thi
s, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me, your old father..." he paused
 unexpectedly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked "but if I hear tha
t you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolkonski, I shall be ashamed!"  "Y
ou need not have said that to me, Father," said the son with a smile.  The old ma
n was silent.  "I also wanted to ask you," continued Prince Andrew, "if I'm kille
d and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from youas I said yesterday..
. let him grow up with you.... Please."  "Not let the wife have him?" said the ol
d man, and laughed.  They stood silent, facing one another. The old man's sharp e
yes were fixed straight on his son's. Something twitched in the lower part of the
 old prince's face.  "We've said goodby. Go!" he suddenly shouted in a loud, angr
y voice, opening his door.  "What is it? What?" asked both princesses when they s
aw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a whit
e dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.  Prince Andr
ew sighed and made no reply.  "Well!" he said, turning to his wife.  And this "We
ll!" sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying, "Now go through your performanc
e."  "Andrew, already!" said the little princess, turning pale and looking with d
ismay at her husband.  He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his 
shoulder.  He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her fac
e, and carefully placed her in an easy chair.  "Adieu, Mary," said he gently to h
is sister, taking her by the hand and kissing her, and then he left the room with
 rapid steps.  The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne ch
afing her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sisterinlaw, still looked with h
er beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince Andrew had gone 
and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From the study, like pistol shot
s, came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Pr
ince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the o
ld man in the white dressing gown looked out.  "Gone? That's all right!" said he 
and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovi
ngly and slammed the door.      BOOK TWO 1805      CHAPTER I   In October, 1805, 
a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the Archduchy of Austria, 
and yet other regiments freshly arriving from Russia were settling near the fortr
ess of Braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau
 was the headquarters of the commanderinchief, Kutuzov.  On October 11, 1805, one
 of the infantry regiments that had just reached Braunau had halted half a mile f
rom the town, waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief. Despite the unRu
ssian appearance of the locality and surroundingsfruit gardens, stone fences, til
ed roofs, and hills in the distanceand despite the fact that the inhabitants who 
gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not Russians, the regiment had just the
 appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the h
eart of Russia.  On the evening of the last day's march an order had been receive
d that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though the
 words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the question 
arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it was decided at a
 consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade 
order, on the principle that it is always better to "bow too low than not bow low
 enough." So the soldiers, after a twentymile march, were kept mending and cleani
ng all night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company com
manders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the regimentinstead of the stragg
ling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day beforepresented a we
llordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had
 every button and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only 
externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief to look un
der the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in every kna
psack the appointed number of articles, "awl, soap, and all," as the soldiers say
. There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It wa
s the state of the soldiers' boots. More than half the men's boots were in holes.
 But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spi
te of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat, an
d the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.  The commander of the regime
nt was an elderly, choleric, stout, and thickset general with grizzled eyebrows a
nd whiskers, and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a 
brandnew uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epau
lettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He ha
d the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life. 
He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up, slightl
y arching his back. It was plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoice
d in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to ind
icate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied 
no small part of his thoughts.  "Well, Michael Mitrich, sir?" he said, addressing
 one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that 
they both felt happy. "We had our hands full last night. However, I think the reg
iment is not a bad one, eh?"  The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony 
and laughed.  "It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsaritsin Meadow.
"  "What?" asked the commander.  At that moment, on the road from the town on whi
ch signalers had been posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aidede
camp followed by a Cossack.  The aidedecamp was sent to confirm the order which h
ad not been clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief wi
shed to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march in t
heir greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation whatever.  A member of th
e Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutuzov the day before with proposals and
 demands for him to join up with the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and
 Kutuzov, not considering this junction advisable, meant, among other arguments i
n support of his view, to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which t
he troops arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment 
so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander in chief w
ould be. Though the aidedecamp did not know these circumstances, he nevertheless 
delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in ma
rching order, and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On
 hearing this the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoul
ders, and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.  "A fine mess we've made o
f it!" he remarked.  "There now! Didn't I tell you, Michael Mitrich, that if it w
as said 'on the march' it meant in greatcoats?" said he reproachfully to the batt
alion commander. "Oh, my God!" he added, stepping resolutely forward. "Company co
mmanders!" he shouted in a voice accustomed to command. "Sergeants major!... How 
soon will he be here?" he asked the aidedecamp with a respectful politeness evide
ntly relating to the personage he was referring to.  "In an hour's time, I should
 say."  "Shall we have time to change clothes?"  "I don't know, General...."  The
 regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the soldiers to chan
ge into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off to their companies, the 
sergeants major began bustling the greatcoats were not in very good condition, an
d instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent bega
n to sway and stretch and hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to 
and fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling t
he straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves o
n with upraised arms.  In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares h
ad become gray instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky s
teps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.  "Whatever is 
this? This!" he shouted and stood still. "Commander of the third company!"  "Comm
ander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to the general... 
third company to the commander." The words passed along the lines and an adjutant
 ran to look for the missing officer.  When the eager but misrepeated words had r
eached their destination in a cry of "The general to the third company," the miss
ing officer appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middleaged man 
and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward t
he general. The captain's face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told t
o repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of 
which was evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The ge
neral looked the captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace a
s he approached.  "You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this
?" shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a 
soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth, which c
ontrasted with the others. "What have you been after? The commander in chief is e
xpected and you leave your place? Eh? I'll teach you to dress the men in fancy co
ats for a parade.... Eh...?"  The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed o
n his superior, pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in th
is pressure lay his only hope of salvation.  "Well, why don't you speak? Whom hav
e you got there dressed up as a Hungarian?" said the commander with an austere gi
be.  "Your excellency..."  "Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But wha
t about your excellency?... nobody knows."  "Your excellency, it's the officer Do
lokhov, who has been reduced to the ranks," said the captain softly.  "Well? Has 
he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier? If a soldier, he should
 be dressed in regulation uniform like the others."  "Your excellency, you gave h
im leave yourself, on the march."  "Gave him leave? Leave? That's just like you y
oung men," said the regimental commander cooling down a little. "Leave indeed....
 One says a word to you and you... What?" he added with renewed irritation, "I be
g you to dress your men decently."  And the commander, turning to look at the adj
utant, directed his jerky steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his ow
n display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse
 for wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another beca
use his line was not straight, he reached the third company.  "Hoow are you stand
ing? Where's your leg? Your leg?" shouted the commander with a tone of suffering 
in his voice, while there were still five men between him and Dolokhov with his b
luishgray uniform.  Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight 
with his clear, insolent eyes in the general's face.  "Why a blue coat? Off with 
it... Sergeant major! Change his coat... the ras..." he did not finish.  "General
, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure..." Dolokhov hurriedly interru
pted.  "No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!"  "Not bound to endur
e insults," Dolokhov concluded in loud, ringing tones.  The eyes of the general a
nd the soldier met. The general became silent, angrily pulling down his tight sca
rf.  "I request you to have the goodness to change your coat," he said as he turn
ed away.      CHAPTER II   "He's coming!" shouted the signaler at that moment.  T
he regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup with trem
bling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself, drew his saber, a
nd with a happy and resolute countenance, opening his mouth awry, prepared to sho
ut. The regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless
.  "Attention!" shouted the regimental commander in a soulshaking voice which exp
ressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and welcome for the approachin
g chief.  Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high
, light blue Viennese caleche, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six 
horses at a smart trot. Behind the caleche galloped the suite and a convoy of Cro
ats. Beside Kutuzov sat an Austrian general, in a white uniform that looked stran
ge among the Russian black ones. The caleche stopped in front of the regiment. Ku
tuzov and the Austrian general were talking in low voices and Kutuzov smiled slig
htly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two t
housand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist
.  The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a jingl
ing sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the c
ommander in chief was heard. The regiment roared, "Health to your ex... len... le
n... lency!" and again all became silent. At first Kutuzov stood still while the 
regiment moved then he and the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked
 between the ranks.  From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander 
in chief and devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and fro
m the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward and ha
rdly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he darted forward at 
every word or gesture of the commander in chief, it was evident that he performed
 his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander. T
hanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment, in compariso
n with others that had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid conditio
n. There were only 217 sick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except t
he boots.  Kutuzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few frie
ndly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes also to the sol
diers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly, pointing the
m out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was 
not blaming anyone, but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was
. The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a s
ingle word of the commander in chief's regarding the regiment. Behind Kutuzov, at
 a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed some twen
ty men of his suite. These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughe
d. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant. This was 
Prince Bolkonski. Beside him was his comrade Nesvitski, a tall staff officer, ext
remely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. Nesvitski cou
ld hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked besi
de him. This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the exp
ression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental commander's back and mimicked h
is every movement. Each time the commander started and bent forward, the hussar s
tarted and bent forward in exactly the same manner. Nesvitski laughed and nudged 
the others to make them look at the wag.  Kutuzov walked slowly and languidly pas
t thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief. 
On reaching the third company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected
 this, involuntarily came closer to him.  "Ah, Timokhin!" said he, recognizing th
e rednosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.  On
e would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than Timokhi
n had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander, but now that the 
commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it see
med he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look a
t him, and so Kutuzov, who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing b
ut good, quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scar
red and puffy face.  "Another Ismail comrade," said he. "A brave officer! Are you
 satisfied with him?" he asked the regimental commander.  And the latterunconscio
us that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glassstarted
, moved forward, and answered "Highly satisfied, your excellency!"  "We all have 
our weaknesses," said Kutuzov smiling and walking away from him. "He used to have
 a predilection for Bacchus."  The regimental commander was afraid he might be bl
amed for this and did not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of t
he rednosed captain and his drawnin stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose
 with such exactitude that Nesvitski could not help laughing. Kutuzov turned roun
d. The officer evidently had complete control of his face, and while Kutuzov was 
turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious, deferential, an
d innocent expression.  The third company was the last, and Kutuzov pondered, app
arently trying to recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among t
he suite and said in French  "You told me to remind you of the officer Dolokhov, 
reduced to the ranks in this regiment."  "Where is Dolokhov?" asked Kutuzov.  Dol
okhov, who had already changed into a soldier's gray greatcoat, did not wait to b
e called. The shapely figure of the fairhaired soldier, with his clear blue eyes,
 stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the commander in chief, and presented
 arms.  "Have you a complaint to make?" Kutuzov asked with a slight frown.  "This
 is Dolokhov," said Prince Andrew.  "Ah!" said Kutuzov. "I hope this will be a le
sson to you. Do your duty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan't forget you if yo
u deserve well."  The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as bo
ldly as they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression 
to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely
 from a private.  "One thing I ask of your excellency," Dolokhov said in his firm
, ringing, deliberate voice. "I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prov
e my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!"  Kutuzov turned away. Th
e same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from Captain Timokhin again fli
tted over his face. He turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything Do
lokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him, th
at he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and we
nt to the carriage.  The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their ap
pointed quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and 
to rest after their hard marches.  "You won't bear me a grudge, Prokhor Ignatych?
" said the regimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its q
uarters and riding up to Captain Timokhin who was walking in front. The regimenta
l commander's face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepress
ible delight. "It's in the Emperor's service... it can't be helped... one is some
times a bit hasty on parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He wa
s very pleased!" And he held out his hand to the captain.  "Don't mention it, Gen
eral, as if I'd be so bold!" replied the captain, his nose growing redder as he g
ave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked
 out by the butt end of a gun at Ismail.  "And tell Mr. Dolokhov that I won't for
get himhe may be quite easy. And tell me, pleaseI've been meaning to askhow is he
 behaving himself, and in general..."  "As far as the service goes he is quite pu
nctilious, your excellency but his character..." said Timokhin.  "And what about 
his character?" asked the regimental commander.  "It's different on different day
s," answered the captain. "One day he is sensible, well educated, and goodnatured
, and the next he's a wild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a
 Jew."  "Oh, well, well!" remarked the regimental commander. "Still, one must hav
e pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important connections... Wel
l, then, you just..."  "I will, your excellency," said Timokhin, showing by his s
mile that he understood his commander's wish.  "Well, of course, of course!"  The
 regimental commander sought out Dolokhov in the ranks and, reining in his horse,
 said to him  "After the next affair... epaulettes."  Dolokhov looked round but d
id not say anything, nor did the mocking smile on his lips change.  "Well, that's
 all right," continued the regimental commander. "A cup of vodka for the men from
 me," he added so that the soldiers could hear. "I thank you all! God be praised!
" and he rode past that company and overtook the next one.  "Well, he's really a 
good fellow, one can serve under him," said Timokhin to the subaltern beside him.
  "In a word, a hearty one..." said the subaltern, laughing the regimental comman
der was nicknamed King of Hearts.  The cheerful mood of their officers after the 
inspection infected the soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers' voi
ces could be heard on every side.  "And they said Kutuzov was blind of one eye?" 
 "And so he is! Quite blind!"  "No, friend, he is sharpereyed than you are. Boots
 and leg bands... he noticed everything..."  "When he looked at my feet, friend..
. well, thinks I..."  "And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he
 were smeared with chalkas white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as they d
o the guns."  "I say, Fedeshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You 
were near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau."  "Buonapar
te himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn't know! The Prussians are u
p in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are putting them down. When they've been p
ut down, the war with Buonaparte will begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau
! Shows you're a fool. You'd better listen more carefully!"  "What devils these q
uartermasters are! See, the fifth company is turning into the village already... 
they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters."  "Give me a 
biscuit, you devil!"  "And did you give me tobacco yesterday? That's just it, fri
end! Ah, well, never mind, here you are."  "They might call a halt here or we'll 
have to do another four miles without eating."  "Wasn't it fine when those German
s gave us lifts! You just sit still and are drawn along."  "And here, friend, the
 people are quite beggarly. There they all seemed to be Polesall under the Russia
n crownbut here they're all regular Germans."  "Singers to the front" came the ca
ptain's order.  And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A 
drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing his arm, 
began a longdrawnout soldiers' song, commencing with the words "Morning dawned, t
he sun was rising," and concluding "On then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father
 Kamenski." This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sun
g in Austria, the only change being that the words "Father Kamenski" were replace
d by "Father Kutuzov."  Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and wav
ed his arms as if flinging something to the ground, the drummera lean, handsome s
oldier of fortylooked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes. Then having
 satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him, he raised both arms as if car
efully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and, holding it 
there for some seconds, suddenly flung it down and began  "Oh, my bower, oh, my b
ower...!"  "Oh, my bower new...!" chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet playe
r, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front and, walking 
backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets a
s if threatening someone. The soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time spon
taneously, marched with long steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the c
reaking of springs, and the tramp of horses' hoofs were heard. Kutuzov and his su
ite were returning to the town. The commander in chief made a sign that the men s
hould continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the 
sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly
 marching men. In the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage
 passed the company, a blueeyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was Do
lokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and lookin
g at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching 
with the company. The hussar cornet of Kutuzov's suite who had mimicked the regim
ental commander, fell back from the carriage and rode up to Dolokhov.  Hussar cor
net Zherkov had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to the wild set led by Dolok
hov. Zherkov had met Dolokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recogni
ze him. But now that Kutuzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him
 with the cordiality of an old friend.  "My dear fellow, how are you?" said he th
rough the singing, making his horse keep pace with the company.  "How am I?" Dolo
khov answered coldly. "I am as you see."  The lively song gave a special flavor t
o the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherkov spoke, and to the intention
al coldness of Dolokhov's reply.  "And how do you get on with the officers?" inqu
ired Zherkov.  "All right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto 
the staff?"  "I was attached I'm on duty."  Both were silent.  "She let the hawk 
fly upward from her wide right sleeve," went the song, arousing an involuntary se
nsation of courage and cheerfulness. Their conversation would probably have been 
different but for the effect of that song.  "Is it true that Austrians have been 
beaten?" asked Dolokhov.  "The devil only knows! They say so."  "I'm glad," answe
red Dolokhov briefly and clearly, as the song demanded.  "I say, come round some 
evening and we'll have a game of faro!" said Zherkov.  "Why, have you too much mo
ney?"  "Do come."  "I can't. I've sworn not to. I won't drink and won't play till
 I get reinstated."  "Well, that's only till the first engagement."  "We shall se
e."  They were again silent.  "Come if you need anything. One can at least be of 
use on the staff..."  Dolokhov smiled. "Don't trouble. If I want anything, I won'
t begI'll take it!"  "Well, never mind I only..."  "And I only..."  "Goodby."  "G
ood health..."          "It's a long, long way.         To my native land..."   Z
herkov touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from foot to foot un
certain with which to start, then settled down, galloped past the company, and ov
ertook the carriage, still keeping time to the song.      CHAPTER III   On return
ing from the review, Kutuzov took the Austrian general into his private room and,
 calling his adjutant, asked for some papers relating to the condition of the tro
ops on their arrival, and the letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, 
who was in command of the advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolkonski came into the ro
om with the required papers. Kutuzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath
 were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.  "Ah!..." said Kutuzov
 glancing at Bolkonski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wa
it, and he went on with the conversation in French.  "All I can say, General," sa
id he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to l
isten to each deliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kutuzov himself liste
ned with pleasure to his own voice. "All I can say, General, is that if the matte
r depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis wou
ld have been fulfilled long ago. I should long ago have joined the archduke. And 
believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over
 the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more ski
llful generalof whom Austria has so manyand to lay down all this heavy responsibi
lity. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us, General."  And Kutuzov s
miled in a way that seemed to say, "You are quite at liberty not to believe me an
d I don't even care whether you do or not, but you have no grounds for telling me
 so. And that is the whole point."  The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but
 had no option but to reply in the same tone.  "On the contrary," he said, in a q
uerulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, "on the contra
ry, your excellency's participation in the common action is highly valued by His 
Majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops a
nd their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battl
es," he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence.  Kutuzov bowed with the sam
e smile.  "But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which H
is Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the Austrian tr
oops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack, have by now al
ready gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid," said Kutuzov.  The g
eneral frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat, there we
re many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so 
Kutuzov's suggestion of an Austrian victory sounded much like irony. But Kutuzov 
went on blandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say that he had
 a right to suppose so. And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mack's
 army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army
 was very favorable.  "Give me that letter," said Kutuzov turning to Prince Andre
w. "Please have a look at it"and Kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners
 of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in German, from
 the Archduke Ferdinand's letter   We have fully concentrated forces of nearly se
venty thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the 
Lech. Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of c
ommanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not cross the Lech, 
we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line of communications, recross t
he river lower down, and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whol
e force against our faithful ally. We shall therefore confidently await the momen
t when the Imperial Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conju
nction with it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves. 
  Kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of t
he Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.  "But you know the wise maxim your excel
lency, advising one to expect the worst," said the Austrian general, evidently wi
shing to have done with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked ro
und at the aidedecamp.  "Excuse me, General," interrupted Kutuzov, also turning t
o Prince Andrew. "Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlovski all the reports f
rom our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one from His 
Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these," he said, handing him several
 papers, "make a neat memorandum in French out of all this, showing all the news 
we have had of the movements of the Austrian army, and then give it to his excell
ency."  Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first
 not only what had been said but also what Kutuzov would have liked to tell him. 
He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both, stepped softly over the carpet 
and went out into the waiting room.  Though not much time had passed since Prince
 Andrew had left Russia, he had changed greatly during that period. In the expres
sion of his face, in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his
 former affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time to 
think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with agreeable and in
teresting work. His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those aroun
d him, his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive.  Kutuzov, whom he 
had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly, promised not to forget him
, distinguished him above the other adjutants, and had taken him to Vienna and gi
ven him the more serious commissions. From Vienna Kutuzov wrote to his old comrad
e, Prince Andrew's father.   Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguishe
d by his industry, firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have 
such a subordinate by me.   On Kutuzov's staff, among his fellow officers and in 
the army generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two q
uite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be different fro
m themselves and from everyone else, expected great things of him, listened to hi
m, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince Andrew was natural and pleasan
t. Others, the majority, disliked him and considered him conceited, cold, and dis
agreeable. But among these people Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so tha
t they respected and even feared him.  Coming out of Kutuzov's room into the wait
ing room with the papers in his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the ai
dedecamp on duty, Kozlovski, who was sitting at the window with a book.  "Well, P
rince?" asked Kozlovski.  "I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we a
re not advancing."  "And why is it?"  Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.  "Any
 news from Mack?"  "No."  "If it were true that he has been beaten, news would ha
ve come."  "Probably," said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.  But at t
hat instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the order of Maria There
sa on his neck and a black bandage round his head, who had evidently just arrived
, entered quickly, slamming the door. Prince Andrew stopped short.  "Commander in
 Chief Kutuzov?" said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh Ger
man accent, looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door.  
"The commander in chief is engaged," said Kozlovski, going hurriedly up to the un
known general and blocking his way to the door. "Whom shall I announce?"  The unk
nown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlovski, who was rather short, as if s
urprised that anyone should not know him.  "The commander in chief is engaged," r
epeated Kozlovski calmly.  The general's face clouded, his lips quivered and trem
bled. He took out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out t
he leaf, gave it to Kozlovski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw himself i
nto a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, "Why do they look at me?" 
Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as if he intended to say something, b
ut immediately, with affected indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a 
queer sound which immediately broke off. The door of the private room opened and 
Kutuzov appeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged head bent forward 
as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides with his
 thin legs, went up to Kutuzov.  "Vous voyez le malheureux Mack," he uttered in a
 broken voice.  Kutuzov's face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
 immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his 
forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully, closed his eyes, si
lently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed the door himself behind him
.  The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten and th
at the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct. Within half an hou
r adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed that the
 Russian troops, who had hitherto been inactive, would also soon have to meet the
 enemy.  Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest 
lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the details of
 his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost, understood all the d
ifficulties of the Russian army's position, and vividly imagined what awaited it 
and the part he would have to play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at t
he thought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week's time he mi
ght, perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the French si
nce Suvorov met them. He feared that Bonaparte's genius might outweigh all the co
urage of the Russian troops, and at the same time could not admit the idea of his
 hero being disgraced.  Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew wen
t toward his room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corr
idor he met Nesvitski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherkov they were 
as usual laughing.  "Why are you so glum?" asked Nesvitski noticing Prince Andrew
's pale face and glittering eyes.  "There's nothing to be gay about," answered Bo
lkonski.  Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvitski and Zherkov, there came toward them
 from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general who on Kutuzov'
s staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army, and the member of the 
Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening. There was room enough in the 
wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily, but Zherk
ov, pushing Nesvitski aside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,  "They're c
oming!... they're coming!... Stand aside, make way, please make way!"  The genera
ls were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions. O
n the face of the wag Zherkov there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee whic
h he seemed unable to suppress.  "Your excellency," said he in German, stepping f
orward and addressing the Austrian general, "I have the honor to congratulate you
."  He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other, aw
kwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.  The member of the Hofkriegsrath looke
d at him severely but, seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but 
give him a moment's attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listeni
ng.  "I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite well,
 only a little bruised just here," he added, pointing with a beaming smile to his
 head.  The general frowned, turned away, and went on.  "Gott, wie naiv!" * said 
he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.        * "Good God, what simplicity!" 
  Nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but Bolkonski, turni
ng still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and turned to Zherkov. The ner
vous irritation aroused by the appearance of Mack, the news of his defeat, and th
e thought of what lay before the Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkov's un
timely jest.  "If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself," he said sharpl
y, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, "I can't prevent your doing so but I
 warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence, I will teach you to b
ehave yourself."  Nesvitski and Zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that t
hey gazed at Bolkonski silently with wideopen eyes.  "What's the matter? I only c
ongratulated them," said Zherkov.  "I am not jesting with you please be silent!" 
cried Bolkonski, and taking Nesvitski's arm he left Zherkov, who did not know wha
t to say.  "Come, what's the matter, old fellow?" said Nesvitski trying to soothe
 him.  "What's the matter?" exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his excitem
ent. "Don't you understand that either we are officers serving our Tsar and our c
ountry, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common 
cause, or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master's business. Qua
rante mille hommes massacres et l'armee de nos allies detruite, et vous trouvez l
a le mot pour rire," * he said, as if strengthening his views by this French sent
ence. "C'est bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait u
n ami, mais pas pour vous, pas pour vous. *2 Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himse
lf in this way," he added in Russianbut pronouncing the word with a French accent
having noticed that Zherkov could still hear him.        * "Forty thousand men ma
ssacred and the army of our allies      destroyed, and you find that a cause for 
jesting!"       * 2 "It is all very well for that goodfornothing fellow      of w
hom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for      you."   He waited a mom
ent to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned and went out of the cor
ridor.      CHAPTER IV   The Pavlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Brau
nau. The squadron in which Nicholas Rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the
 German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were assigned to c
avalrycaptain Denisov, the squadron commander, known throughout the whole cavalry
 division as Vaska Denisov. Cadet Rostov, ever since he had overtaken the regimen
t in Poland, had lived with the squadron commander.  On October 11, the day when 
all was astir at headquarters over the news of Mack's defeat, the camp life of th
e officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual. Denisov, who had been losing
 at cards all night, had not yet come home when Rostov rode back early in the mor
ning from a foraging expedition. Rostov in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his 
horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful
 movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse,
 and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.  "Ah, Bondarenko, dear friend
!" said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse. "Walk him up and do
wn, my dear fellow," he continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodh
earted young people show to everyone when they are happy.  "Yes, your excellency,
" answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his head.  "Mind, walk him up and down we
ll!"  Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarenko had already thr
own the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse's head. It was evident that th
e cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him. Rostov patted th
e horse's neck and then his flank, and lingered for a moment.  "Splendid! What a 
horse he will be!" he thought with a smile, and holding up his saber, his spurs j
ingling, he ran up the steps of the porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a
 pointed cap, pitchfork in hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked ou
t, and his face immediately brightened on seeing Rostov. "Schon gut Morgen! Schon
 gut Morgen!" * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased to greet th
e young man.       * "A very good morning! A very good morning!"   "Schon fleissi
g?" * said Rostov with the same gay brotherly smile which did not leave his eager
 face. "Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch!" *2 said he, quotin
g words often repeated by the German landlord.       * "Busy already?"      * 2 "
Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians!      Hurrah for Emperor Alexan
der!"   The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and wavi
ng it above his head cried  "Und die ganze Welt hoch!" *       * "And hurrah for 
the whole world!"   Rostov waved his cap above his head like the German and cried
 laughing, "Und vivat die ganze Welt!" Though neither the German cleaning his cow
shed nor Rostov back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for re
joicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love, wagged
 their heads in token of their mutual affection, and parted smiling, the German r
eturning to his cowshed and Rostov going to the cottage he occupied with Denisov.
  "What about your master?" he asked Lavrushka, Denisov's orderly, whom all the r
egiment knew for a rogue.  "Hasn't been in since the evening. Must have been losi
ng," answered Lavrushka. "I know by now, if he wins he comes back early to brag a
bout it, but if he stays out till morning it means he's lost and will come back i
n a rage. Will you have coffee?"  "Yes, bring some."  Ten minutes later Lavrushka
 brought the coffee. "He's coming!" said he. "Now for trouble!" Rostov looked out
 of the window and saw Denisov coming home. Denisov was a small man with a red fa
ce, sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an unfaste
ned cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled shako on the bac
k of his head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging his head.  "Lavwuska!" h
e shouted loudly and angrily, "take it off, blockhead!"  "Well, I am taking it of
f," replied Lavrushka's voice.  "Ah, you're up already," said Denisov, entering t
he room.  "Long ago," answered Rostov, "I have already been for the hay, and have
 seen Fraulein Mathilde."  "Weally! And I've been losing, bwother. I lost yesterd
ay like a damned fool!" cried Denisov, not pronouncing his r's. "Such ill luck! S
uch ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on. Hullo there! Tea!"  Puck
ering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong teeth, he began wi
th stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair.  "And 
what devil made me go to that wat?" an officer nicknamed "the rat" he said, rubbi
ng his forehead and whole face with both hands. "Just fancy, he didn't let me win
 a single cahd, not one cahd."  He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him,
 gripped it in his fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while
 he continued to shout.  "He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as o
ne doubles it gives the singles and snatches the doubles!"  He scattered the burn
ing tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away. Then he remained silent for a w
hile, and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rostov
.  "If at least we had some women here but there's nothing foh one to do but dwin
k. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who's there?" he said, turning t
o the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came
 to a stop, and a respectful cough.  "The squadron quartermaster!" said Lavrushka
.  Denisov's face puckered still more.  "Wetched!" he muttered, throwing down a p
urse with some gold in it. "Wostov, deah fellow, just see how much there is left 
and shove the purse undah the pillow," he said, and went out to the quartermaster
.  Rostov took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins in sep
arate piles, began counting them.  "Ah! Telyanin! How d'ye do? They plucked me la
st night," came Denisov's voice from the next room.  "Where? At Bykov's, at the r
at's... I knew it," replied a piping voice, and Lieutenant Telyanin, a small offi
cer of the same squadron, entered the room.  Rostov thrust the purse under the pi
llow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him. Telyanin for some reas
on had been transferred from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved ver
y well in the regiment but was not liked Rostov especially detested him and was u
nable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.  "Well, young c
avalryman, how is my Rook behaving?" he asked. Rook was a young horse Telyanin ha
d sold to Rostov.  The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straigh
t in the face his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.  "I saw y
ou riding this morning..." he added.  "Oh, he's all right, a good horse," answere
d Rostov, though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not wo
rth half that sum. "He's begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg," he added
.  "The hoof's cracked! That's nothing. I'll teach you what to do and show you wh
at kind of rivet to use."  "Yes, please do," said Rostov.  "I'll show you, I'll s
how you! It's not a secret. And it's a horse you'll thank me for."  "Then I'll ha
ve it brought round," said Rostov wishing to avoid Telyanin, and he went out to g
ive the order.  In the passage Denisov, with a pipe, was squatting on the thresho
ld facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing Rostov, Denisov s
crewed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room wher
e Telyanin was sitting, he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust.  "Ugh! I don't 
like that fellow," he said, regardless of the quartermaster's presence.  Rostov s
hrugged his shoulders as much as to say "Nor do I, but what's one to do?" and, ha
ving given his order, he returned to Telyanin.  Telyanin was sitting in the same 
indolent pose in which Rostov had left him, rubbing his small white hands.  "Well
 there certainly are disgusting people," thought Rostov as he entered.  "Have you
 told them to bring the horse?" asked Telyanin, getting up and looking carelessly
 about him.  "I have."  "Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denisov ab
out yesterday's order. Have you got it, Denisov?"  "Not yet. But where are you of
f to?"  "I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse," said Telyanin.  The
y went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant explained how to riv
et the hoof and went away to his own quarters.  When Rostov went back there was a
 bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table. Denisov was sitting there scratching
 with his pen on a sheet of paper. He looked gloomily in Rostov's face and said "
I am witing to her."  He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand 
and, evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write, 
told Rostov the contents of his letter.  "You see, my fwiend," he said, "we sleep
 when we don't love. We are childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one
 is a God, one is pua' as on the first day of cweation... Who's that now? Send hi
m to the devil, I'm busy!" he shouted to Lavrushka, who went up to him not in the
 least abashed.  "Who should it be? You yourself told him to come. It's the quart
ermaster for the money."  Denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but s
topped.  "Wetched business," he muttered to himself. "How much is left in the puh
se?" he asked, turning to Rostov.  "Seven new and three old imperials."  "Oh, it'
s wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you sca'cwow? Call the quahtehm
asteh," he shouted to Lavrushka.  "Please, Denisov, let me lend you some I have s
ome, you know," said Rostov, blushing.  "Don't like bowwowing from my own fellows
, I don't," growled Denisov.  "But if you won't accept money from me like a comra
de, you will offend me. Really I have some," Rostov repeated.  "No, I tell you." 
 And Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.  "Where have
 you put it, Wostov?"  "Under the lower pillow."  "It's not there."  Denisov thre
w both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.  "That's a miwacle."  "Wait
, haven't you dropped it?" said Rostov, picking up the pillows one at a time and 
shaking them.  He pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.  "D
ear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept it under your
 head like a treasure," said Rostov. "I put it just here. Where is it?" he asked,
 turning to Lavrushka.  "I haven't been in the room. It must be where you put it.
"  "But it isn't?..."  "You're always like that you thwow a thing down anywhere a
nd forget it. Feel in your pockets."  "No, if I hadn't thought of it being a trea
sure," said Rostov, "but I remember putting it there."  Lavrushka turned all the 
bedding over, looked under the bed and under the table, searched everywhere, and 
stood still in the middle of the room. Denisov silently watched Lavrushka's movem
ents, and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to 
be found Denisov glanced at Rostov.  "Wostov, you've not been playing schoolboy t
wicks..."  Rostov felt Denisov's gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and instantl
y dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below hi
s throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not draw breath.  "And there hasn'
t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves. It must be here s
omewhere," said Lavrushka.  "Now then, you devil's puppet, look alive and hunt fo
r it!" shouted Denisov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with a th
reatening gesture. "If the purse isn't found I'll flog you, I'll flog you all."  
Rostov, his eyes avoiding Denisov, began buttoning his coat, buckled on his saber
, and put on his cap.  "I must have that purse, I tell you," shouted Denisov, sha
king his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.  "Denisov, l
et him alone, I know who has taken it," said Rostov, going toward the door withou
t raising his eyes. Denisov paused, thought a moment, and, evidently understandin
g what Rostov hinted at, seized his arm.  "Nonsense!" he cried, and the veins on 
his forehead and neck stood out like cords. "You are mad, I tell you. I won't all
ow it. The purse is here! I'll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be found." 
 "I know who has taken it," repeated Rostov in an unsteady voice, and went to the
 door.  "And I tell you, don't you dahe to do it!" shouted Denisov, rushing at th
e cadet to restrain him.  But Rostov pulled away his arm and, with as much anger 
as though Denisov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his fac
e.  "Do you understand what you're saying?" he said in a trembling voice. "There 
was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it is not so, then..."  He 
could not finish, and ran out of the room.  "Ah, may the devil take you and evewy
body," were the last words Rostov heard.  Rostov went to Telyanin's quarters.  "T
he master is not in, he's gone to headquarters," said Telyanin's orderly. "Has so
mething happened?" he added, surprised at the cadet's troubled face.  "No, nothin
g."  "You've only just missed him," said the orderly.  The headquarters were situ
ated two miles away from Salzeneck, and Rostov, without returning home, took a ho
rse and rode there. There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented
. Rostov rode up to it and saw Telyanin's horse at the porch.  In the second room
 of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wi
ne.  "Ah, you've come here too, young man!" he said, smiling and raising his eyeb
rows.  "Yes," said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word and he
 sat down at the nearest table.  Both were silent. There were two Germans and a R
ussian officer in the room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatt
er of knives and the munching of the lieutenant.  When Telyanin had finished his 
lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and, drawing its rings aside with 
his small, white, turnedup fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eye
brows gave it to the waiter.  "Please be quick," he said.  The coin was a new one
. Rostov rose and went up to Telyanin.  "Allow me to look at your purse," he said
 in a low, almost inaudible, voice.  With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised
, Telyanin handed him the purse.  "Yes, it's a nice purse. Yes, yes," he said, gr
owing suddenly pale, and added, "Look at it, young man."  Rostov took the purse i
n his hand, examined it and the money in it, and looked at Telyanin. The lieutena
nt was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.  "I
f we get to Vienna I'll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns th
ere's nowhere to spend it," said he. "Well, let me have it, young man, I'm going.
"  Rostov did not speak.  "And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed yo
u quite decently here," continued Telyanin. "Now then, let me have it."  He stret
ched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostov let go of it. Telyanin took t
he purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches,
 with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open, as if to say, "Yes, yes, I
 am putting my purse in my pocket and that's quite simple and is no one else's bu
siness."  "Well, young man?" he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted brows
 he glanced into Rostov's eyes.  Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Tel
yanin's eyes to Rostov's and back, and back again and again in an instant.  "Come
 here," said Rostov, catching hold of Telyanin's arm and almost dragging him to t
he window. "That money is Denisov's you took it..." he whispered just above Telya
nin's ear.  "What? What? How dare you? What?" said Telyanin.  But these words cam
e like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon. As soon as Rostov he
ard them, an enormous load of doubt fell from him. He was glad, and at the same i
nstant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had 
begun had to be completed.  "Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine,"
 muttered Telyanin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. "We m
ust have an explanation..."  "I know it and shall prove it," said Rostov.  "I..."
  Every muscle of Telyanin's pale, terrified face began to quiver, his eyes still
 shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to Rostov's face, 
and his sobs were audible.  "Count!... Don't ruin a young fellow... here is this 
wretched money, take it..." He threw it on the table. "I have an old father and m
other!..."  Rostov took the money, avoiding Telyanin's eyes, and went out of the 
room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps. "O G
od," he said with tears in his eyes, "how could you do it?"  "Count..." said Tely
anin drawing nearer to him.  "Don't touch me," said Rostov, drawing back. "If you
 need it, take the money," and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn. 
     CHAPTER V   That same evening there was an animated discussion among the squ
adron's officers in Denisov's quarters.  "And I tell you, Rostov, that you must a
pologize to the colonel!" said a tall, grizzlyhaired staff captain, with enormous
 mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features, to Rostov who was crimson wit
h excitement.  The staff captain, Kirsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks fo
r affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.  "I will allow no one t
o call me a liar!" cried Rostov. "He told me I lied, and I told him he lied. And 
there it rests. He may keep me on duty every day, or may place me under arrest, b
ut no one can make me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, th
inks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then..."  "You just wait a m
oment, my dear fellow, and listen," interrupted the staff captain in his deep bas
s, calmly stroking his long mustache. "You tell the colonel in the presence of ot
her officers that an officer has stolen..."  "I'm not to blame that the conversat
ion began in the presence of other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken b
efore them, but I am not a diplomatist. That's why I joined the hussars, thinking
 that here one would not need finesse and he tells me that I am lyingso let him g
ive me satisfaction..."  "That's all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that'
s not the point. Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to
 demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?"  Denisov sat gloomily biting h
is mustache and listening to the conversation, evidently with no wish to take par
t in it. He answered the staff captain's question by a disapproving shake of his 
head.  "You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers,
" continued the staff captain, "and Bogdanich" the colonel was called Bogdanich "
shuts you up."  "He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth."  "Well
, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize."  "Not 
on any account!" exclaimed Rostov.  "I did not expect this of you," said the staf
f captain seriously and severely. "You don't wish to apologize, but, man, it's no
t only to him but to the whole regimentall of usyou're to blame all round. The ca
se is this you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice but no, you
 go and blurt it all straight out before the officers. Now what was the colonel t
o do? Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole 
regiment because of one scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don't see it li
ke that. And Bogdanich was a brick he told you you were saying what was not true.
 It's not pleasant, but what's to be done, my dear fellow? You landed yourself in
 it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some conceit prevents your
 apologizing, and you wish to make the whole affair public. You are offended at b
eing put on duty a bit, but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer? Wh
atever Bogdanich may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! You're 
quick at taking offense, but you don't mind disgracing the whole regiment!" The s
taff captain's voice began to tremble. "You have been in the regiment next to no 
time, my lad, you're here today and tomorrow you'll be appointed adjutant somewhe
re and can snap your fingers when it is said 'There are thieves among the Pavlogr
ad officers!' But it's not all the same to us! Am I not right, Denisov? It's not 
the same!"  Denisov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked wit
h his glittering black eyes at Rostov.  "You value your own pride and don't wish 
to apologize," continued the staff captain, "but we old fellows, who have grown u
p in and, God willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of th
e regiment, and Bogdanich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And all this 
is not right, it's not right! You may take offense or not but I always stick to m
other truth. It's not right!"  And the staff captain rose and turned away from Ro
stov.  "That's twue, devil take it!" shouted Denisov, jumping up. "Now then, Wost
ov, now then!"   Rostov, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one of
ficer and then at the other.  "No, gentlemen, no... you mustn't think... I quite 
understand. You're wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of t
he regiment I'd... Ah well, I'll show that in action, and for me the honor of the
 flag... Well, never mind, it's true I'm to blame, to blame all round. Well, what
 else do you want?..."  "Come, that's right, Count!" cried the staff captain, tur
ning round and clapping Rostov on the shoulder with his big hand.  "I tell you," 
shouted Denisov, "he's a fine fellow."  "That's better, Count," said the staff ca
ptain, beginning to address Rostov by his title, as if in recognition of his conf
ession. "Go and apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!"  "Gentlemen, I'll do anythi
ng. No one shall hear a word from me," said Rostov in an imploring voice, "but I 
can't apologize, by God I can't, do what you will! How can I go and apologize lik
e a little boy asking forgiveness?"  Denisov began to laugh.  "It'll be worse for
 you. Bogdanich is vindictive and you'll pay for your obstinacy," said Kirsten.  
"No, on my word it's not obstinacy! I can't describe the feeling. I can't..."  "W
ell, it's as you like," said the staff captain. "And what has become of that scou
ndrel?" he asked Denisov.  "He has weported himself sick, he's to be stwuck off t
he list tomowwow," muttered Denisov.  "It is an illness, there's no other way of 
explaining it," said the staff captain.  "Illness or not, he'd better not cwoss m
y path. I'd kill him!" shouted Denisov in a bloodthirsty tone.  Just then Zherkov
 entered the room.  "What brings you here?" cried the officers turning to the new
comer.  "We're to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his whole 
army."  "It's not true!"  "I've seen him myself!"  "What? Saw the real Mack? With
 hands and feet?"  "Into action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! B
ut how did you come here?"  "I've been sent back to the regiment all on account o
f that devil, Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on 
Mack's arrival... What's the matter, Rostov? You look as if you'd just come out o
f a hot bath."  "Oh, my dear fellow, we're in such a stew here these last two day
s."  The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by Zherkov. T
hey were under orders to advance next day.  "We're going into action, gentlemen!"
  "Well, thank God! We've been sitting here too long!"      CHAPTER VI   Kutuzov 
fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers Inn at
 Braunau and Traun near Linz. On October 23 the Russian troops were crossing the 
river Enns. At midday the Russian baggage train, the artillery, and columns of tr
oops were defiling through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.  It was 
a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out before the heights 
on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a
 diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlig
ht, fardistant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnish
ed. Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, redroofed houses, i
ts cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of 
Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with 
a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube beca
me visible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with
 a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a conven
t stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of t
he Enns the enemy's horse patrols could be discerned.  Among the field guns on th
e brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff off
icer, scanning the country through his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvitski
, who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on th
e trail of a gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsac
k and a flask, and Nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelku
mmel. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their knees, some squatting
 Turkish fashion on the wet grass.  "Yes, the Austrian prince who built that cast
le was no fool. It's a fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?" N
esvitski was saying.  "Thank you very much, Prince," answered one of the officers
, pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. "It's a lovely pla
ce! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a splendid house!"  
"Look, Prince," said another, who would have dearly liked to take another pie but
 felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside"See, our infan
trymen have already got there. Look there in the meadow behind the village, three
 of them are dragging something. They'll ransack that castle," he remarked with e
vident approval.  "So they will," said Nesvitski. "No, but what I should like," a
dded he, munching a pie in his moistlipped handsome mouth, "would be to slip in o
ver there."  He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed
 and gleamed.  "That would be fine, gentlemen!"  The officers laughed.  "Just to 
flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls among them. On my word I
'd give five years of my life for it!"  "They must be feeling dull, too," said on
e of the bolder officers, laughing.  Meanwhile the staff officer standing in fron
t pointed out something to the general, who looked through his field glass.  "Yes
, so it is, so it is," said the general angrily, lowering the field glass and shr
ugging his shoulders, "so it is! They'll be fired on at the crossing. And why are
 they dawdling there?"  On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked
 eye, and from their battery a milkwhite cloud arose. Then came the distant repor
t of a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.  Nesvitski ro
se, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.  "Would not your excellency lik
e a little refreshment?" he said.  "It's a bad business," said the general withou
t answering him, "our men have been wasting time."  "Hadn't I better ride over, y
our excellency?" asked Nesvitski.  "Yes, please do," answered the general, and he
 repeated the order that had already once been given in detail "and tell the huss
ars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered and the infla
mmable material on the bridge must be reinspected."  "Very good," answered Nesvit
ski.  He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack and
 flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.  "I'll really call in 
on the nuns," he said to the officers who watched him smilingly, and he rode off 
by the winding path down the hill.  "Now then, let's see how far it will carry, C
aptain. Just try!" said the general, turning to an artillery officer. "Have a lit
tle fun to pass the time."  "Crew, to your guns!" commanded the officer.  In a mo
ment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading.  "One!" c
ame the command.  Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafen
ing metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops bel
ow the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke showing the spot wher
e it burst.  The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone g
ot up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly visible as
 if but a stone's throw away, and the movements of the approaching enemy farther 
off. At the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds, and the c
lear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged 
in a single joyous and spirited impression.      CHAPTER VII   Two of the enemy's
 shots had already flown across the bridge, where there was a crush. Halfway acro
ss stood Prince Nesvitski, who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was
 jammed against the railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a 
few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince Nesvit
ski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him ag
ainst the railings, and all he could do was to smile.  "What a fine fellow you ar
e, friend!" said the Cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon, who was pressing o
nto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses.
 "What a fellow! You can't wait a moment! Don't you see the general wants to pass
?"  But the convoyman took no notice of the word "general" and shouted at the sol
diers who were blocking his way. "Hi there, boys! Keep to the left! Wait a bit." 
But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to shoulder, their bayonets interlock
ing, moved over the bridge in a dense mass. Looking down over the rails Prince Ne
svitski saw the rapid, noisy little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying
 round the piles of the bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he 
saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos, kn
apsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with broad cheekbon
es, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and feet that moved through th
e sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge. Sometimes through the monoton
ous waves of men, like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer
, in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his
 way along sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot
, an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry and sometim
es like a log floating down the river, an officers' or company's baggage wagon, p
iled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on all sides, moved across the bridge. 
 "It's as if a dam had burst," said the Cossack hopelessly. "Are there many more 
of you to come?"  "A million all but one!" replied a waggish soldier in a torn co
at, with a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.  "If he" he meant
 the enemy "begins popping at the bridge now," said the old soldier dismally to a
 comrade, "you'll forget to scratch yourself."  That soldier passed on, and after
 him came another sitting on a cart.  "Where the devil have the leg bands been sh
oved to?" said an orderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it
.  And he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers who had ev
idently been drinking.  "And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with
 the butt end of his gun..." a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said ga
ily, with a wide swing of his arm.  "Yes, the ham was just delicious..." answered
 another with a loud laugh. And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvitski did not l
earn who had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.  "Bah! 
How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they'll all be killed," a se
rgeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.  "As it flies past me, Daddy, the ba
ll I mean," said a young soldier with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from l
aughing, "I felt like dying of fright. I did, 'pon my word, I got that frightened
!" said he, as if bragging of having been frightened.  That one also passed. Then
 followed a cart unlike any that had gone before. It was a German cart with a pai
r of horses led by a German, and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. 
A fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman w
ith an unweaned baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red che
eks were sitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were allowed to 
pass by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women,
 and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers' remarks related
 to the two young ones. Every face bore almost the same smile, expressing unseeml
y thoughts about the women.  "Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!
"  "Sell me the missis," said another soldier, addressing the German, who, angry 
and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast eyes.  "See how smart sh
e's made herself! Oh, the devils!"  "There, Fedotov, you should be quartered on t
hem!"  "I have seen as much before now, mate!"  "Where are you going?" asked an i
nfantry officer who was eating an apple, also half smiling as he looked at the ha
ndsome girl.  The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand. 
 "Take it if you like," said the officer, giving the girl an apple.  The girl smi
led and took it. Nesvitski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take hi
s eyes off the women till they had passed. When they had gone by, the same stream
 of soldiers followed, with the same kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As of
ten happens, the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge
, and the whole crowd had to wait.  "And why are they stopping? There's no proper
 order!" said the soldiers. "Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can't you 
wait? It'll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here's an officer jammed in too
"different voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked at one another, and
 all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.  Looking down at the waters of the 
Enns under the bridge, Nesvitski suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something 
swiftly approaching... something big, that splashed into the water.  "Just see wh
ere it carries to!" a soldier near by said sternly, looking round at the sound.  
"Encouraging us to get along quicker," said another uneasily.  The crowd moved on
 again. Nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball.  "Hey, Cossack, my horse!" 
he said. "Now, then, you there! get out of the way! Make way!"  With great diffic
ulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting continually he moved on. The so
ldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him, but again pressed on him so that 
they jammed his leg, and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themse
lves pressed still harder from behind.  "Nesvitski, Nesvitski! you numskull!" cam
e a hoarse voice from behind him.  Nesvitski looked round and saw, some fifteen p
aces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry, Vaska Denisov, red
 and shaggy, with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jaunt
ily over his shoulder.  "Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!" shoute
d Denisov evidently in a fit of rage, his coalblack eyes with their bloodshot whi
tes glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as
 red as his face.  "Ah, Vaska!" joyfully replied Nesvitski. "What's up with you?"
  "The squadwon can't pass," shouted Vaska Denisov, showing his white teeth fierc
ely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which twitched its ears as the bayo
nets touched it, and snorted, spurting white foam from his bit, tramping the plan
ks of the bridge with his hoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings h
ad his rider let him. "What is this? They're like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of 
the way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart! I'll hack you wi
th my saber!" he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flouri
shing it.  The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and Den
isov joined Nesvitski.  "How's it you're not drunk today?" said Nesvitski when th
e other had ridden up to him.  "They don't even give one time to dwink!" answered
 Vaska Denisov. "They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they mean
 to fight, let's fight. But the devil knows what this is."  "What a dandy you are
 today!" said Nesvitski, looking at Denisov's new cloak and saddlecloth.  Denisov
 smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfu
me, and put it to Nesvitski's nose.  "Of course. I'm going into action! I've shav
ed, bwushed my teeth, and scented myself."  The imposing figure of Nesvitski foll
owed by his Cossack, and the determination of Denisov who flourished his sword an
d shouted frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to
 the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the bridge Nesvi
tski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order, and having done this 
he rode back.  Having cleared the way Denisov stopped at the end of the bridge. C
arelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground, eager 
to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw nearer. Then the clang of hoo
fs, as of several horses galloping, resounded on the planks of the bridge, and th
e squadron, officers in front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and 
began to emerge on his side of it.  The infantry who had been stopped crowded nea
r the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of illwil
l, estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encount
er one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in regular order. 
 "Smart lads! Only fit for a fair!" said one.  "What good are they? They're led a
bout just for show!" remarked another.  "Don't kick up the dust, you infantry!" j
ested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.  "
I'd like to put you on a two days' march with a knapsack! Your fine cords would s
oon get a bit rubbed," said an infantryman, wiping the mud off his face with his 
sleeve. "Perched up there, you're more like a bird than a man."  "There now, Ziki
n, they ought to put you on a horse. You'd look fine," said a corporal, chaffing 
a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack.  "Take a stick b
etween your legs, that'll suit you for a horse!" the hussar shouted back.      CH
APTER VIII   The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing tog
ether as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last the baggage w
agons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last battalion came onto the b
ridge. Only Denisov's squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bri
dge facing the enemy, who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but wa
s not yet visible from the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley throug
h which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away. A
t the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our Cossack scout
s were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground, artillery and 
troops in blue uniform were seen. These were the French. A group of Cossack scout
s retired down the hill at a trot. All the officers and men of Denisov's squadron
, though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions, thou
ght only of what was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the pat
ches appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemy's troops. The weat
her had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the Dan
ube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and at intervals the bugle calls a
nd the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill. There was no one now bet
ween the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers. An empty spac
e of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them. The enemy ceased firin
g, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates
 two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.  "One step beyond that boundar
y line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertaint
y, suffering, and death. And what is there? Who is there?there beyond that field,
 that tree, that roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know. You
 fear and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must be c
rossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will inevitably h
ave to learn what lies the other side of death. But you are strong, healthy, chee
rful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and health
y men." So thinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, 
and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to ev
erything that takes place at such moments.  On the high ground where the enemy wa
s, the smoke of a cannon rose, and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hu
ssar squadron. The officers who had been standing together rode off to their plac
es. The hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole 
squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander, a
waiting the word of command. A second and a third cannon ball flew past. Evidentl
y they were firing at the hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew
 over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them. The hussars did n
ot look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of command, the whol
e squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath w
hile the ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers w
ithout turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their comrades'
 impression. Every face, from Denisov's to that of the bugler, showed one common 
expression of conflict, irritation, and excitement, around chin and mouth. The qu
artermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Ca
det Mironov ducked every time a ball flew past. Rostov on the left flank, mounted
 on his Rooka handsome horse despite its game leghad the happy air of a schoolboy
 called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he w
ill distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone with a clear, bright express
ion, as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire. But despite himsel
f, on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round t
he mouth.  "Who's that curtseying there? Cadet Miwonov! That's not wight! Look at
 me," cried Denisov who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept turning his horse
 in front of the squadron.  The black, hairy, snubnosed face of Vaska Denisov, an
d his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in 
which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually did, especia
lly toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle he was only redder than 
usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink, pressing his 
spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as thoug
h falling backwards in the saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron
 and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to
 Kirsten. The staff captain on his broadbacked, steady mare came at a walk to mee
t him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always, only his eyes were 
brighter than usual.  "Well, what about it?" said he to Denisov. "It won't come t
o a fight. You'll seewe shall retire."  "The devil only knows what they're about!
" muttered Denisov. "Ah, Wostov," he cried noticing the cadet's bright face, "you
've got it at last."  And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet
. Rostov felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge. De
nisov galloped up to him.  "Your excellency! Let us attack them! I'll dwive them 
off."  "Attack indeed!" said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his face 
as if driving off a troublesome fly. "And why are you stopping here? Don't you se
e the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron back."  The squadron crossed 
the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man. The se
cond squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last C
ossacks quitted the farther side of the river.  The two Pavlograd squadrons, havi
ng crossed the bridge, retired up the hill one after the other. Their colonel, Ka
rl Bogdanich Schubert, came up to Denisov's squadron and rode at a footpace not f
ar from Rostov, without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting f
or the first time since their encounter concerning Telyanin. Rostov, feeling that
 he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that h
e had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel's athletic back, his 
nape covered with light hair, and his red neck. It seemed to Rostov that Bogdanic
h was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test t
he cadet's courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it s
eemed to him that Bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage. Next h
e thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to pu
nish himRostov. Then he imagined how, after the attack, Bogdanich would come up t
o him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation
.  The highshouldered figure of Zherkov, familiar to the Pavlograds as he had but
 recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel. After his dismissal from h
eadquarters Zherkov had not remained in the regiment, saying he was not such a fo
ol as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on th
e staff, and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince B
agration. He now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the
 rear guard.  "Colonel," he said, addressing Rostov's enemy with an air of gloomy
 gravity and glancing round at his comrades, "there is an order to stop and fire 
the bridge."  "An order to who?" asked the colonel morosely.  "I don't myself kno
w 'to who,'" replied the cornet in a serious tone, "but the prince told me to 'go
 and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.'"
  Zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of h
ussars with the same order. After him the stout Nesvitski came galloping up on a 
Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight.  "How's this, Colonel?" he sh
outed as he approached. "I told you to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone 
and blundered they are all beside themselves over there and one can't make anythi
ng out."  The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvitski. 
 "You spoke to me of inflammable material," said he, "but you said nothing about 
firing it."  "But, my dear sir," said Nesvitski as he drew up, taking off his cap
 and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand, "wasn't I tell
ing you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material had been put in position?" 
 "I am not your 'dear sir,' Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell me to burn th
e bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders strictly to obey. You sai
d the bridge would be burned, but who would it burn, I could not know by the holy
 spirit!"  "Ah, that's always the way!" said Nesvitski with a wave of the hand. "
How did you get here?" said he, turning to Zherkov.  "On the same business. But y
ou are damp! Let me wring you out!"  "You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer..." cont
inued the colonel in an offended tone.  "Colonel," interrupted the officer of the
 suite, "You must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot."
  The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout staff off
icer, and at Zherkov, and he frowned.  "I will the bridge fire," he said in a sol
emn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endu
re he would still do the right thing.  Striking his horse with his long muscular 
legs as if it were to blame for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered
 the second squadron, that in which Rostov was serving under Denisov, to return t
o the bridge.  "There, it's just as I thought," said Rostov to himself. "He wishe
s to test me!" His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. "Let him se
e whether I am a coward!" he thought.  Again on all the bright faces of the squad
ron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire. Rostov wa
tched his enemy, the colonel, closelyto find in his face confirmation of his own 
conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostov, and looked as he alway
s did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word of command.  "Look 
sharp! Look sharp!" several voices repeated around him.  Their sabers catching in
 the bridles and their spurs jingling, the hussars hastily dismounted, not knowin
g what they were to do. The men were crossing themselves. Rostov no longer looked
 at the colonel, he had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so 
much afraid that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse in
to an orderly's charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud. Deni
sov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something. Rostov saw nothing but th
e hussars running all around him, their spurs catching and their sabers clatterin
g.  "Stretchers!" shouted someone behind him.  Rostov did not think what this cal
l for stretchers meant he ran on, trying only to be ahead of the others but just 
at the bridge, not looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, st
umbled, and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.  "At boss zides, Capta
in," he heard the voice of the colonel, who, having ridden ahead, had pulled up h
is horse near the bridge, with a triumphant, cheerful face.  Rostov wiping his mu
ddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on, thinking t
hat the farther he went to the front the better. But Bogdanich, without looking a
t or recognizing Rostov, shouted to him  "Who's that running on the middle of the
 bridge? To the right! Come back, Cadet!" he cried angrily and turning to Denisov
, who, showing off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge  "Why r
un risks, Captain? You should dismount," he said.  "Oh, every bullet has its bill
et," answered Vaska Denisov, turning in his saddle.   Meanwhile Nesvitski, Zherko
v, and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots,
 watching, now the small group of men with yellow shakos, darkgreen jackets braid
ed with cord, and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and th
en at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite sidethe blue uniform
s and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.  "Will they burn the 
bridge or not? Who'll get there first? Will they get there and fire the bridge or
 will the French get within grapeshot range and wipe them out?" These were the qu
estions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily 
asked himself with a sinking heartwatching the bridge and the hussars in the brig
ht evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bay
onets and guns.  "Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!" said Nesvitski "they are wit
hin grapeshot range now."  "He shouldn't have taken so many men," said the office
r of the suite.  "True enough," answered Nesvitski "two smart fellows could have 
done the job just as well."  "Ah, your excellency," put in Zherkov, his eyes fixe
d on the hussars, but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know w
hether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. "Ah, your excellency! How you look 
at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the Vladimir medal and ribbon
? But now, even if they do get peppered, the squadron may be recommended for hono
rs and he may get a ribbon. Our Bogdanich knows how things are done."  "There now
!" said the officer of the suite, "that's grapeshot."  He pointed to the French g
uns, the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed.  On the Fren
ch side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke appeared, then a second an
d a third almost simultaneously, and at the moment when the first report was hear
d a fourth was seen. Then two reports one after another, and a third.  "Oh! Oh!" 
groaned Nesvitski as if in fierce pain, seizing the officer of the suite by the a
rm. "Look! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen!"  "Two, I think."  "If I were Tsar I
 would never go to war," said Nesvitski, turning away.  The French guns were hast
ily reloaded. The infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a
 run. Smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and 
rattled onto the bridge. But this time Nesvitski could not see what was happening
 there, as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in set
ting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no longer to hi
nder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at.  Th
e French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back t
o their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too high, but the last rou
nd fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them over.  Rosto
v, absorbed by his relations with Bogdanich, had paused on the bridge not knowing
 what to do. There was no one to hew down as he had always imagined battles to hi
mself, nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burnin
g straw with him like the other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when sudden
ly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar ne
arest to him fell against the rails with a groan. Rostov ran up to him with the o
thers. Again someone shouted, "Stretchers!" Four men seized the hussar and began 
lifting him.  "Oooh! For Christ's sake let me alone!" cried the wounded man, but 
still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.  Nicholas Rostov turned away and, 
as if searching for something, gazed into the distance, at the waters of the Danu
be, at the sky, and at the sun. How beautiful the sky looked how blue, how calm, 
and how deep! How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter
 the waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer still were the faraway blue m
ountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and the pine fores
ts veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace and happiness... "I sho
uld wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I were there," thought Rostov. "In my
self alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness but here... groans, su
ffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry... Therethey are shouting again, an
d again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death,
 is here above me and around... Another instant and I shall never again see the s
un, this water, that gorge!..."  At that instant the sun began to hide behind the
 clouds, and other stretchers came into view before Rostov. And the fear of death
 and of the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one feel
ing of sickening agitation.  "O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forg
ive, and protect me!" Rostov whispered.  The hussars ran back to the men who held
 their horses their voices sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared 
from sight.  "Well, fwiend? So you've smelt powdah!" shouted Vaska Denisov just a
bove his ear.  "It's all over but I am a cowardyes, a coward!" thought Rostov, an
d sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one foot, from the 
orderly and began to mount.  "Was that grapeshot?" he asked Denisov.  "Yes and no
 mistake!" cried Denisov. "You worked like wegular bwicks and it's nasty work! An
 attack's pleasant work! Hacking away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the 
very devil, with them shooting at you like a target."  And Denisov rode up to a g
roup that had stopped near Rostov, composed of the colonel, Nesvitski, Zherkov, a
nd the officer from the suite.  "Well, it seems that no one has noticed," thought
 Rostov. And this was true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the se
nsation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.  "Here's s
omething for you to report," said Zherkov. "See if I don't get promoted to a subl
ieutenancy."  "Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!" said the colonel trium
phantly and gaily.  "And if he asks about the losses?"  "A trifle," said the colo
nel in his bass voice "two hussars wounded, and one knocked out," he added, unabl
e to restrain a happy smile, and pronouncing the phrase "knocked out" with ringin
g distinctness.      CHAPTER IX   Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousan
d men under the command of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriend
ly to it, losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies, 
and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been forese
en, the Russian army of thirtyfive thousand men commanded by Kutuzov was hurriedl
y retreating along the Danube, stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting
 rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losin
g its heavy equipment. There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk but
 despite the courage and enduranceacknowledged even by the enemywith which the Ru
ssians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat
. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kutuzov at Braun
au now separated from the Russian army, and Kutuzov was left with only his own we
ak and exhausted forces. The defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. In
stead of an offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the m
odern science of strategics, had been handed to Kutuzov when he was in Vienna by 
the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for hi
m was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from Russia, witho
ut losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.  On the twentyeighth of October Kutuz
ov with his army crossed to the left bank of the Danube and took up a position fo
r the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the French. 
On the thirtieth he attacked Mortier's division, which was on the left bank, and 
broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were taken banners, canno
n, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a fortnight's retreat, the R
ussian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had re
pulsed the French. Though the troops were illclad, exhausted, and had lost a thir
d of their number in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers though a number of sic
k and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter in
 which Kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and though the big hos
pitals and the houses in Krems converted into military hospitals could no longer 
accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the victory
 over Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably. Throughout the whole a
rmy and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imag
inary approach of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, a
nd of the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.  Prince Andrew during the battle h
ad been in attendance on the Austrian General Schmidt, who was killed in the acti
on. His horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bul
let. As a mark of the commander in chief's special favor he was sent with the new
s of this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna which was threat
ened by the French but at Brunn. Despite his apparently delicate build Prince And
rew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men, and on 
the night of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited but not weary, with disp
atches from Dokhturov to Kutuzov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch
 to Brunn. To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward pro
motion.  The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that ha
d fallen the previous daythe day of the battle. Reviewing his impressions of the 
recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victo
ry would create, or recalling the sendoff given him by the commander in chief and
 his fellow officers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying
 the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a longdesired happiness.
 As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the whee
ls and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that the Russians were 
running away and that he himself was killed, but he quickly roused himself with a
 feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contr
ary the French had run away. He again recalled all the details of the victory and
 his own calm courage during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... T
he dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was thaw
ing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides of the road w
ere forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.  At one of the post station
s he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded. The Russian officer in charge of the t
ransport lolled back in the front cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coar
se abuse. In each of the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men 
were being jolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking he heard Russian
 words, others were eating bread the more severely wounded looked silently, with 
the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy hurrying past them.  Prince A
ndrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what action they had been w
ounded. "Day before yesterday, on the Danube," answered the soldier. Prince Andre
w took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces.  "That's for them al
l," he said to the officer who came up.  "Get well soon, lads!" he continued, tur
ning to the soldiers. "There's plenty to do still."  "What news, sir?" asked the 
officer, evidently anxious to start a conversation.  "Good news!... Go on!" he sh
outed to the driver, and they galloped on.  It was already quite dark when Prince
 Andrew rattled over the paved streets of Brunn and found himself surrounded by h
igh buildings, the lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and
 all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to 
a soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night, Prince 
Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he h
ad done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followe
d one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity. He again vividly recalle
d the details of the battle, no longer dim, but definite and in the concise form 
in which he imagined himself stating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imag
ined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give.
 He expected to be at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance to the
 palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and learning that he 
was a special messenger led him to another entrance.  "To the right from the corr
idor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will find the adjutant on duty," said the offic
ial. "He will conduct you to the Minister of War."  The adjutant on duty, meeting
 Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went in to the Minister of War. Five minut
es later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew be
fore him along a corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. T
he adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at
 familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.  Prince Andrew's joyous feelin
g was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the minister's room. He 
felt offended, and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately tur
ned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly 
suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant a
nd the minister. "Away from the smell of powder, they probably think it easy to g
ain victories!" he thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room o
f the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain w
as heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some paper
s and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes taking 
no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the minister's bent 
bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading to the end, without raising h
is eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps.  "Take this and de
liver it," said he to his adjutant, handing him the papers and still taking no no
tice of the special messenger.  Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kut
uzov's army interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he 
was concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that impre
ssion. "But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me," he thought. The mini
ster drew the remaining papers together, arranged them evenly, and then raised hi
s head. He had an intellectual and distinctive head, but the instant he turned to
 Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evid
ently deliberate and habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial smil
e which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who is continual
ly receiving many petitioners one after another.  "From General Field Marshal Kut
uzov?" he asked. "I hope it is good news? There has been an encounter with Mortie
r? A victory? It was high time!"  He took the dispatch which was addressed to him
 and began to read it with a mournful expression.  "Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!"
 he exclaimed in German. "What a calamity! What a calamity!"  Having glanced thro
ugh the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at Prince Andrew, evidently c
onsidering something.  "Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But 
Mortier is not captured." Again he pondered. "I am very glad you have brought goo
d news, though Schmidt's death is a heavy price to pay for the victory. His Majes
ty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I thank you! You must have a res
t. Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade. However, I will let you know."  The
 stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking, reappeared.  "Au re
voir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to see you," he added
, bowing his head.  When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the inter
est and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indiffere
nt hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The whole tenor of his t
houghts instantaneously changed the battle seemed the memory of a remote event lo
ng past.      CHAPTER X   Prince Andrew stayed at Brunn with Bilibin, a Russian a
cquaintance of his in the diplomatic service.  "Ah, my dear prince! I could not h
ave a more welcome visitor," said Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. "
Franz, put the prince's things in my bedroom," said he to the servant who was ush
ering Bolkonski in. "So you're a messenger of victory, eh? Splendid! And I am sit
ting here ill, as you see."  After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into 
the diplomat's luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bilib
in settled down comfortably beside the fire.  After his journey and the campaign 
during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the 
refinements of life, Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxuriou
s surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was p
leasant, after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian for the
y were speaking French at least with a Russian who would, he supposed, share the 
general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was then particularly strong.  B
ilibin was a man of thirtyfive, a bachelor, and of the same circle as Prince Andr
ew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but had become more intim
ate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutuzov. Just as Prince Andrew was a yo
ung man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession, so to an even
 greater extent Bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career. He still
 a young man but no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the
 age of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather importan
t post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him
 and valued him. He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because 
they have certain negative qualities, avoid doing certain things, and speak Frenc
h. He was one of those, who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indo
lence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked well wh
atever the import of his work. It was not the question "What for?" but the questi
on "How?" that interested him. What the diplomatic matter might be he did not car
e, but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, s
killfully, pointedly, and elegantly. Bilibin's services were valued not only for 
what he wrote, but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the
 highest spheres.  Bilibin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it coul
d be made elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say som
ething striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible. His 
conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original, finished phrases of gene
ral interest. These sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in 
a portable form as if intentionally, so that insignificant society people might c
arry them from drawing room to drawing room. And, in fact, Bilibin's witticisms w
ere hawked about in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matt
ers considered important.  His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrin
kles, which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one's fingers a
fter a Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of 
expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eye
brows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease
 his cheeks. His small, deepset eyes always twinkled and looked out straight.  "W
ell, now tell me about your exploits," said he.  Bolkonski, very modestly without
 once mentioning himself, described the engagement and his reception by the Minis
ter of War.  "They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of ski
ttles," said he in conclusion.  Bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disap
peared.  "Cependant, mon cher," he remarked, examining his nails from a distance 
and puckering the skin above his left eye, "malgre la haute estime que je profess
e pour the Orthodox Russian army, j'avoue que votre victoire n'est pas des plus v
ictorieuses." *        * "But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodo
x      Russian army, I must say that your victory was not      particularly victo
rious."   He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in 
Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.  "Come now! You with a
ll your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and his one division, and even the
n Mortier slips through your fingers! Where's the victory?"  "But seriously," sai
d Prince Andrew, "we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little be
tter than at Ulm..."  "Why didn't you capture one, just one, marshal for us?"  "B
ecause not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade. 
We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by seven in the morning but 
had not reached it by five in the afternoon."  "And why didn't you do it at seven
 in the morning? You ought to have been there at seven in the morning," returned 
Bilibin with a smile. "You ought to have been there at seven in the morning."  "W
hy did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he h
ad better leave Genoa alone?" retorted Prince Andrew in the same tone.  "I know,"
 interrupted Bilibin, "you're thinking it's very easy to take marshals, sitting o
n a sofa by the fire! That is true, but still why didn't you capture him? So don'
t be surprised if not only the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty t
he Emperor and King Francis is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor
 secretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my joy to giv
e my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the Prater... True, we ha
ve no Prater here..."  He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkle
d his forehead.  "It is now my turn to ask you 'why?' mon cher," said Bolkonski. 
"I confess I do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyon
d my feeble intelligence, but I can't make it out. Mack loses a whole army, the A
rchduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs of life and make blunder af
ter blunder. Kutuzov alone at last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of 
the invincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care to he
ar the details."  "That's just it, my dear fellow. You see it's hurrah for the Ts
ar, for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what do 
we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring us nice news of a v
ictory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand one archduke's as good as another, as yo
u know and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte's, that will be an
other story and we'll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done on 
purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgrac
es himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its defenseas much as to say 'Heaven is w
ith us, but heaven help you and your capital!' The one general whom we all loved,
 Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Ad
mit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived. It's as i
f it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose you did gain a brilli
ant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a victory, what effect would that h
ave on the general course of events? It's too late now when Vienna is occupied by
 the French army!"  "What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?"  "Not only occupied, but B
onaparte is at Schonbrunn, and the count, our dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for o
rders."  After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and es
pecially after having dined, Bolkonski felt that he could not take in the full si
gnificance of the words he heard.  "Count Lichtenfels was here this morning," Bil
ibin continued, "and showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vien
na was fully described Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that your v
ictory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can't be received as a sa
vior."  "Really I don't care about that, I don't care at all," said Prince Andrew
, beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems was really of 
small importance in view of such events as the fall of Austria's capital. "How is
 it Vienna was taken? What of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince
 Auersperg? We heard reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?" he said
.  "Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is defending usdoi
ng it very badly, I think, but still he is defending us. But Vienna is on the oth
er side. No, the bridge has not yet been taken and I hope it will not be, for it 
is mined and orders have been given to blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago h
ave been in the mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would have spent a ba
d quarter of an hour between two fires."  "But still this does not mean that the 
campaign is over," said Prince Andrew.  "Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here th
ink so too, but they daren't say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the
 campaign, it won't be your skirmishing at Durrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that
 will decide the matter, but those who devised it," said Bilibin quoting one of h
is own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and pausing. "The only quest
ion is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor Alexander and the King o
f Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia joins the Allies, Austria's hand will be forced a
nd there will be war. If not it is merely a question of settling where the prelim
inaries of the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up."  "What an extraordinary geni
us!" Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed, clenching his small hand and striking the 
table with it, "and what luck the man has!"  "Buonaparte?" said Bilibin inquiring
ly, puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witt
y. "Buonaparte?" he repeated, accentuating the u "I think, however, now that he l
ays down laws for Austria at Schonbrunn, il faut lui faire grace de l'u! * I shal
l certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!"       * "We must 
let him off the u!"   "But joking apart," said Prince Andrew, "do you really thin
k the campaign is over?"  "This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of,
 and she is not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the fi
rst place because her provinces have been pillagedthey say the Holy Russian army 
loots terriblyher army is destroyed, her capital taken, and all this for the beau
x yeux * of His Sardinian Majesty. And thereforethis is between ourselvesI instin
ctively feel that we are being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations wit
h France and projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately."       * Fi
ne eyes.   "Impossible!" cried Prince Andrew. "That would be too base."  "If we l
ive we shall see," replied Bilibin, his face again becoming smooth as a sign that
 the conversation was at an end.  When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared fo
r him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragra
nt pillows, he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far 
away from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria's treachery, Bonaparte's new tr
iumph, tomorrow's levee and parade, and the audience with the Emperor Francis occ
upied his thoughts.  He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, 
of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now 
again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill, the Frenc
h were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside Schmid
t with the bullets merrily whistling all around, and he experienced tenfold the j
oy of living, as he had not done since childhood.  He woke up...  "Yes, that all 
happened!" he said, and, smiling happily to himself like a child, he fell into a 
deep, youthful slumber.      CHAPTER XI   Next day he woke late. Recalling his re
cent impressions, the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had
 to be presented to the Emperor Francis he remembered the Minister of War, the po
lite Austrian adjutant, Bilibin, and last night's conversation. Having dressed fo
r his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had not worn for a lon
g time, he went into Bilibin's study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his hand
 bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Prince 
Hippolyte Kuragin, who was a secretary to the embassy, Bolkonski was already acqu
ainted. Bilibin introduced him to the others.  The gentlemen assembled at Bilibin
's were young, wealthy, gay society men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special
 set which Bilibin, their leader, called les notres. * This set, consisting almos
t exclusively of diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to 
do with war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to the
 official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of t
hemselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From politeness and to start con
versation, they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle, and then
 the talk went off into merry jests and gossip.       * Ours.   "But the best of 
it was," said one, telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat, "that the Chan
cellor told him flatly that his appointment to London was a promotion and that he
 was so to regard it. Can you fancy the figure he cut?..."  "But the worst of it,
 gentlemenI am giving Kuragin away to youis that that man suffers, and this Don J
uan, wicked fellow, is taking advantage of it!"  Prince Hippolyte was lolling in 
a lounge chair with his legs over its arm. He began to laugh.  "Tell me about tha
t!" he said.  "Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!" cried several voices.  "You, Bolko
nski, don't know," said Bilibin turning to Prince Andrew, "that all the atrocitie
s of the French army I nearly said of the Russian army are nothing compared to wh
at this man has been doing among the women!"  "La femme est la compagne de l'homm
e," * announced Prince Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his el
evated legs.       * "Woman is man's companion."   Bilibin and the rest of "ours"
 burst out laughing in Hippolyte's face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of
 whomhe had to admithe had almost been jealous on his wife's account, was the but
t of this set.  "Oh, I must give you a treat," Bilibin whispered to Bolkonski. "K
uragin is exquisite when he discusses politicsyou should see his gravity!"  He sa
t down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about pol
itics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these two.  "The Berlin cabine
t cannot express a feeling of alliance," began Hippolyte gazing round with import
ance at the others, "without expressing... as in its last note... you understand.
.. Besides, unless His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our al
liance...  "Wait, I have not finished..." he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him b
y the arm, "I believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention. An
d..." he paused. "Finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of Nov
ember 18. That is how it will end." And he released Bolkonski's arm to indicate t
hat he had now quite finished.  "Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secr
etest in thy golden mouth!" said Bilibin, and the mop of hair on his head moved w
ith satisfaction.  Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was ev
idently distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild laugh
ter that convulsed his usually impassive features.  "Well now, gentlemen," said B
ilibin, "Bolkonski is my guest in this house and in Brunn itself. I want to enter
tain him as far as I can, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vien
na it would be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficu
lt, and I beg you all to help me. Brunn's attractions must be shown him. You can 
undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course the women."  "We 
must let him see Amelie, she's exquisite!" said one of "ours," kissing his finger
 tips.  "In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interes
ts," said Bilibin.  "I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality
, gentlemen, it is already time for me to go," replied Prince Andrew looking at h
is watch.  "Where to?"  "To the Emperor."  "Oh! Oh! Oh! Well, au revoir, Bolkonsk
i! Au revoir, Prince! Come back early to dinner," cried several voices. "We'll ta
ke you in hand."  "When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise 
the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated," said Bilibin, acc
ompanying him to the hall.  "I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I
 know the facts, I can't," replied Bolkonski, smiling.  "Well, talk as much as yo
u can, anyway. He has a passion for giving audiences, but he does not like talkin
g himself and can't do it, as you will see."      CHAPTER XII   At the levee Prin
ce Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had been told to, and the Emper
or Francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with his lo
ng head. But after it was over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremon
iously informed Bolkonski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The E
mperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the conver
sation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed confuse
d and blushed as if not knowing what to say.  "Tell me, when did the battle begin
?" he asked hurriedly.  Prince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just
 as simple "Was Kutuzov well? When had he left Krems?" and so on. The Emperor spo
ke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questionsthe answers to these
 questions, as was only too evident, did not interest him.  "At what o'clock did 
the battle begin?" asked the Emperor.  "I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o'cl
ock the battle began at the front, but at Durrenstein, where I was, our attack be
gan after five in the afternoon," replied Bolkonski growing more animated and exp
ecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which he had ready
 in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor smiled and interrupted
 him.  "How many miles?"  "From where to where, Your Majesty?"  "From Durrenstein
 to Krems."  "Three and a half miles, Your Majesty."  "The French have abandoned 
the left bank?"  "According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts durin
g the night."  "Is there sufficient forage in Krems?"  "Forage has not been suppl
ied to the extent..."  The Emperor interrupted him.  "At what o'clock was General
 Schmidt killed?"  "At seven o'clock, I believe."  "At seven o'clock? It's very s
ad, very sad!"  The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdr
ew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he saw fr
iendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday's adjutant reproached him for no
t having stayed at the palace, and offered him his own house. The Minister of War
 came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, whi
ch the Emperor was conferring on him. The Empress' chamberlain invited him to see
 Her Majesty. The archduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom to ans
wer, and for a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador to
ok him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to him.  Contrar
y to Bilibin's forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received. A thanksgi
ving service was arranged, Kutuzov was awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, 
and the whole army received rewards. Bolkonski was invited everywhere, and had to
 spend the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between f
our and five in the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to Bil
ibin's house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit t
o Brunn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage. Franz, Bilibin's ma
n, was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door.  Before
 returning to Bilibin's Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to provide himself w
ith some books for the campaign, and had spent some time in the shop.  "What is i
t?" he asked.  "Oh, your excellency!" said Franz, with difficulty rolling the por
tmanteau into the vehicle, "we are to move on still farther. The scoundrel is aga
in at our heels!"  "Eh? What?" asked Prince Andrew.  Bilibin came out to meet him
. His usually calm face showed excitement.  "There now! Confess that this is deli
ghtful," said he. "This affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have cros
sed without striking a blow!"  Prince Andrew could not understand.  "But where do
 you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?"  "I come from 
the archduchess'. I heard nothing there."  "And you didn't see that everybody is 
packing up?"  "I did not... What is it all about?" inquired Prince Andrew impatie
ntly.  "What's it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that Auerspe
rg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up so Murat is now rushing along t
he road to Brunn and will be here in a day or two."  "What? Here? But why did the
y not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?"  "That is what I ask you. No one, not
 even Bonaparte, knows why."  Bolkonski shrugged his shoulders.  "But if the brid
ge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It will be cut off," said he.  
"That's just it," answered Bilibin. "Listen! The French entered Vienna as I told 
you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those gentlemen, messieurs les mar
echaux, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard, mount and ride to the bridge. Observe that
 all three are Gascons. 'Gentlemen,' says one of them, 'you know the Thabor Bridg
e is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its hea
d and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and 
not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we tak
e this bridge, so let us three go and take it!' 'Yes, let's!' say the others. And
 off they go and take the bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on 
this side of the Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication."  
     * The marshalls.   "Stop jesting," said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. T
his news grieved him and yet he was pleased.  As soon as he learned that the Russ
ian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who w
as destined to lead it out of this position that here was the Toulon that would l
ift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame! 
Listening to Bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would g
ive an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the
 army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan.  "Stop
 this jesting," he said  "I am not jesting," Bilibin went on. "Nothing is truer o
r sadder. These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs
 they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to neg
otiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the tetedepont. * They spin him 
a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is a
rranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and 
so on. The officer sends for Auersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers, crac
k jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge u
nobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches 
the tetedepont. At length appears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auerspe
rg von Mautern himself. 'Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Tu
rkish wars Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another's hand.... The Emperor
 Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg's acquaintance.' In a wo
rd, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is
 so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and s
o dazzled by the sight of Murat's mantle and ostrich plumes, qu'il n'y voit que d
u feu, et oublie celui qu'il devait faire faire sur l'ennemi!" *2 In spite of the
 animation of his speech, Bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot to give 
time for its due appreciation. "The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, sp
ikes the guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all," he went on, his
 excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, "is that th
e sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines
 and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French troops were runnin
g onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand. The sergeant, w
ho was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says 'Prince, y
ou are being deceived, here are the French!' Murat, seeing that all is lost if th
e sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment he i
s a true Gascon and says 'I don't recognize the worldfamous Austrian discipline, 
if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!' It was a stroke of genius. 
Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arreste
d. Come, you must own that this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is 
not exactly stupidity, nor rascality...."        * Bridgehead.       * 2 That the
ir fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that      he ought to be firing at the 
enemy.   "It may be treachery," said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the gray ov
ercoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the glory that
 awaited him.  "Not that either. That puts the court in too bad a light," replied
 Bilibin. "It's not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is just as at Ulm...
 it is..."he seemed to be trying to find the right expression. "C'est... c'est du
 Mack. Nous sommes mackes It is... it is a bit of Mack. We are Macked," he conclu
ded, feeling that he had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repea
ted. His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a s
light smile he began to examine his nails.  "Where are you off to?" he said sudde
nly to Prince Andrew who had risen and was going toward his room.  "I am going aw
ay."  "Where to?"  "To the army."  "But you meant to stay another two days?"  "Bu
t now I am off at once."  And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his dep
arture went to his room.  "Do you know, mon cher," said Bilibin following him, "I
 have been thinking about you. Why are you going?"  And in proof of the conclusiv
eness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face.  Prince Andrew look
ed inquiringly at him and gave no reply.  "Why are you going? I know you think it
 your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger. I understand that
. Mon cher, it is heroism!"  "Not at all," said Prince Andrew.  "But as you are a
 philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other side of the question and you
 will see that your duty, on the contrary, is to take care of yourself. Leave it 
to those who are no longer fit for anything else.... You have not been ordered to
 return and have not been dismissed from here therefore, you can stay and go with
 us wherever our ill luck takes us. They say we are going to Olmutz, and Olmutz i
s a very decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my caleche."  "Do stop
 joking, Bilibin," cried Bolkonski.  "I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consid
er! Where and why are you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one
 of two things," and the skin over his left temple puckered, "either you will not
 reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will share defeat and disg
race with Kutuzov's whole army."  And Bilibin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that
 the dilemma was insoluble.  "I cannot argue about it," replied Prince Andrew col
dly, but he thought "I am going to save the army."  "My dear fellow, you are a he
ro!" said Bilibin.      CHAPTER XIII   That same night, having taken leave of the
 Minister of War, Bolkonski set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he woul
d find it and fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.  In Brunn
 everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy baggage was alread
y being dispatched to Olmutz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince Andrew struck the high road
 along which the Russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest dis
order. The road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in 
a carriage. Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, an
d hungry and weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the
 commander in chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the position
 of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of the troops in th
eir disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.  "Cette armee russe que l'or de l'A
ngleterre a transportee des extremites de l'univers, nous allons lui faire eprouv
er le meme sortle sort de l'armee d'Ulm." * He remembered these words in Bonapart
e's address to his army at the beginning of the campaign, and they awoke in him a
stonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling of wounded pride, and a hope of 
glory. "And should there be nothing left but to die?" he thought. "Well, if need 
be, I shall do it no worse than others."        * "That Russian army which has be
en brought from the ends of      the earth by English gold, we shall cause to sha
re the same      fatethe fate of the army at Ulm."   He looked with disdain at th
e endless confused mass of detachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage
 wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy r
oad, three and sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far 
as ear could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts and gu
n carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the urging of horse
s, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers. All along the sides of 
the road fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and brokendown car
ts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, and again soldiers s
traggling from their companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring village
s, or returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At each a
scent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting m
ore incessant. Soldiers floundering kneedeep in mud pushed the guns and wagons th
emselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped, traces broke, and lungs were strained wit
h shouting. The officers directing the march rode backward and forward between th
e carts. Their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their 
faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.  "Here is
 our dear Orthodox Russian army," thought Bolkonski, recalling Bilibin's words.  
Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to a convoy. Dir
ectly opposite to him came a strange onehorse vehicle, evidently rigged up by sol
diers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart, a
 cabriolet, and a caleche. A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls
 sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode u
p and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted 
by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of tra
nsport was beating the soldier who was driving the woman's vehicle for trying to 
get ahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipag
e. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind
 the apron and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried  "Mr. Aid
edecamp! Mr. Aidedecamp!... For heaven's sake... Protect me! What will become of 
us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh Chasseurs.... They won't let us pa
ss, we are left behind and have lost our people..."  "I'll flatten you into a pan
cake!" shouted the angry officer to the soldier. "Turn back with your slut!"  "Mr
. Aidedecamp! Help me!... What does it all mean?" screamed the doctor's wife.  "K
indly let this cart pass. Don't you see it's a woman?" said Prince Andrew riding 
up to the officer.  The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again
 to the soldier. "I'll teach you to push on!... Back!"  "Let them pass, I tell yo
u!" repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his lips.  "And who are you?" cried the o
fficer, turning on him with tipsy rage, "who are you? Are you in command here? Eh
? I am commander here, not you! Go back or I'll flatten you into a pancake," repe
ated he. This expression evidently pleased him.  "That was a nice snub for the li
ttle aidedecamp," came a voice from behind.  Prince Andrew saw that the officer w
as in that state of senseless, tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is say
ing. He saw that his championship of the doctor's wife in her queer trap might ex
pose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the worldto ridicule but his in
stinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence Prince Andrew, his 
face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his riding whip.  "Kind...ly 
letthempass!"  The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.  "It's all t
he fault of these fellows on the staff that there's this disorder," he muttered. 
"Do as you like."  Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from 
the doctor's wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with a sense 
of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the v
illage where he was told that the commander in chief was.  On reaching the villag
e he dismounted and went to the nearest house, intending to rest if but for a mom
ent, eat something, and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that
 confused his mind. "This is a mob of scoundrels and not an army," he was thinkin
g as he went up to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called hi
m by name.  He turned round. Nesvitski's handsome face looked out of the little w
indow. Nesvitski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and flourishing h
is arm, called him to enter.  "Bolkonski! Bolkonski!... Don't you hear? Eh? Come 
quick..." he shouted.  Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvitski and anothe
r adjutant having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he
 had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm. This was part
icularly noticeable on Nesvitski's usually laughing countenance.  "Where is the c
ommander in chief?" asked Bolkonski.  "Here, in that house," answered the adjutan
t.  "Well, is it true that it's peace and capitulation?" asked Nesvitski.  "I was
 going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could do to get here."
  "And we, my dear boy! It's terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack, we're gettin
g it still worse," said Nesvitski. "But sit down and have something to eat."  "Yo
u won't be able to find either your baggage or anything else now, Prince. And God
 only knows where your man Peter is," said the other adjutant.  "Where are headqu
arters?"  "We are to spend the night in Znaim."  "Well, I have got all I need int
o packs for two horses," said Nesvitski. "They've made up splendid packs for mefi
t to cross the Bohemian mountains with. It's a bad lookout, old fellow! But what'
s the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that," he added, noticing t
hat Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.  "It's nothing," replied Prince
 Andrew.  He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor's wife and 
the convoy officer.  "What is the commander in chief doing here?" he asked.  "I c
an't make out at all," said Nesvitski.  "Well, all I can make out is that everyth
ing is abominable, abominable, quite abominable!" said Prince Andrew, and he went
 off to the house where the commander in chief was.  Passing by Kutuzov's carriag
e and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite, with their Cossacks who were talk
ing loudly together, Prince Andrew entered the passage. Kutuzov himself, he was t
old, was in the house with Prince Bagration and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Aust
rian general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozlovski was squat
ting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned up, was hasti
ly writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozlovski's face looked wornhe too had
 evidently not slept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not even nod 
to him.  "Second line... have you written it?" he continued dictating to the cler
k. "The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian..."  "One can't write so fast, your honor," sai
d the clerk, glancing angrily and disrespectfully at Kozlovski.  Through the door
 came the sounds of Kutuzov's voice, excited and dissatisfied, interrupted by ano
ther, an unfamiliar voice. From the sound of these voices, the inattentive way Ko
zlovski looked at him, the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact 
that the clerk and Kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the 
commander in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horse
s near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and disastrous was
 about to happen.  He turned to Kozlovski with urgent questions.  "Immediately, P
rince," said Kozlovski. "Dispositions for Bagration."  "What about capitulation?"
  "Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle."  Prince Andrew moved tow
ard the door from whence voices were heard. Just as he was going to open it the s
ounds ceased, the door opened, and Kutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy face app
eared in the doorway. Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutuzov but the expre
ssion of the commander in chief's one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied w
ith thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He looked straight
 at his adjutant's face without recognizing him.  "Well, have you finished?" said
 he to Kozlovski.  "One moment, your excellency."  Bagration, a gaunt middleaged 
man of medium height with a firm, impassive face of Oriental type, came out after
 the commander in chief.  "I have the honor to present myself," repeated Prince A
ndrew rather loudly, handing Kutuzov an envelope.  "Ah, from Vienna? Very good. L
ater, later!"  Kutuzov went out into the porch with Bagration.  "Well, goodby, Pr
ince," said he to Bagration. "My blessing, and may Christ be with you in your gre
at endeavor!"  His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his 
left hand he drew Bagration toward him, and with his right, on which he wore a ri
ng, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual, off
ering his puffy cheek, but Bagration kissed him on the neck instead.  "Christ be 
with you!" Kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriage. "Get in with me," said 
he to Bolkonski.  "Your excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to 
remain with Prince Bagration's detachment."  "Get in," said Kutuzov, and noticing
 that Bolkonski still delayed, he added "I need good officers myself, need them m
yself!"  They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.  "The
re is still much, much before us," he said, as if with an old man's penetration h
e understood all that was passing in Bolkonski's mind. "If a tenth part of his de
tachment returns I shall thank God," he added as if speaking to himself.  Prince 
Andrew glanced at Kutuzov's face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily n
oticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple, where an Ismail bu
llet had pierced his skull, and the empty eye socket. "Yes, he has a right to spe
ak so calmly of those men's death," thought Bolkonski.  "That is why I beg to be 
sent to that detachment," he said.  Kutuzov did not reply. He seemed to have forg
otten what he had been saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, ge
ntly swaying on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew. The
re was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he questioned Pr
ince Andrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor, about the remark
s he had heard at court concerning the Krems affair, and about some ladies they b
oth knew.      CHAPTER XIV   On November 1 Kutuzov had received, through a spy, n
ews that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy report
ed that the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in immens
e force upon Kutuzov's line of communication with the troops that were arriving f
rom Russia. If Kutuzov decided to remain at Krems, Napoleon's army of one hundred
 and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted a
rmy of forty thousand, and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. 
If Kutuzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving fr
om Russia, he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian
 mountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning
 all hope of a junction with Buxhowden. If Kutuzov decided to retreat along the r
oad from Krems to Olmutz, to unite with the troops arriving from Russia, he riske
d being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge,
 and encumbered by his baggage and transport, having to accept battle on the marc
h against an enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.  K
utuzov chose this latter course.  The French, the spy reported, having crossed th
e Vienna bridge, were advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixtysi
x miles off on the line of Kutuzov's retreat. If he reached Znaim before the Fren
ch, there would be great hope of saving the army to let the French forestall him 
at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of Ulm, 
or to utter destruction. But to forestall the French with his whole army was impo
ssible. The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than 
the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.  The night he received the news, K
utuzov sent Bagration's vanguard, four thousand strong, to the right across the h
ills from the KremsZnaim to the ViennaZnaim road. Bagration was to make this marc
h without resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he su
cceeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible. Kutu
zov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.  Marching thirty miles
 that stormy night across roadless hills, with his hungry, illshod soldiers, and 
losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way, Bagration came out on the Vie
nnaZnaim road at Hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching 
Hollabrunn from Vienna. Kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some da
ys before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagration with his four thousand hungry, ex
hausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him
 at Hollabrunn, which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made the imposs
ible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the 
hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutuzov in a simi
lar way. Meeting Bagration's weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to 
be Kutuzov's whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival
 of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and with this objec
t offered a three days' truce on condition that both armies should remain in posi
tion without moving. Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proc
eeding, and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. 
Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed Murat'
s emissary and retired, leaving Bagration's division exposed. Another emissary ro
de to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russia
n army the three days' truce. Bagration replied that he was not authorized either
 to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutuzov to report the offer
 he had received.  A truce was Kutuzov's sole chance of gaining time, giving Bagr
ation's exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys w
hose movements were concealed from the French advance if but one stage nearer Zna
im. The offer of a truce gave the only, and a quite unexpected, chance of saving 
the army. On receiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzi
ngerode, who was in attendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not m
erely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and meanwhil
e Kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the ba
ggage trains of the entire army along the KremsZnaim road. Bagration's exhausted 
and hungry detachment, which alone covered this movement of the transport and of 
the whole army, had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as stron
g as itself.  Kutuzov's expectations that the proposals of capitulation which wer
e in no way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass, and also t
hat Murat's mistake would very soon be discovered, proved correct. As soon as Bon
aparte who was at Schonbrunn, sixteen miles from Hollabrunn received Murat's disp
atch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrot
e the following letter to Murat   Schonbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,  at eight o'cl
ock in the morning  To PRINCE MURAT,  I cannot find words to express to you my di
spleasure. You command only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an arm
istice without my order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Bre
ak the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general 
who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one but the Emper
or of Russia has that right.  If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that co
nvention, I will ratify it but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian 
army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.  The Russian E
mperor's aidedecamp is an impostor. Officers are nothing when they have no powers
 this one had none.... The Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of
 the Vienna bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an aidedecamp of the E
mperor.  NAPOLEON   Bonaparte's adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing lett
er to Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all the 
Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim escape, and Bagra
tion's four thousand men merrily lighted campfires, dried and warmed themselves, 
cooked their porridge for the first time for three days, and not one of them knew
 or imagined what was in store for him.      CHAPTER XV   Between three and four 
o'clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who had persisted in his request to Kutuz
ov, arrived at Grunth and reported himself to Bagration. Bonaparte's adjutant had
 not yet reached Murat's detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagratio
n's detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They talk
ed of peace but did not believe in its possibility others talked of a battle but 
also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement. Bagration, knowing Bolkonski t
o be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with distinction and special m
arks of favor, explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that 
day or the next, and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle
 or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, "which is also
 very important."  "However, there will hardly be an engagement today," said Bagr
ation as if to reassure Prince Andrew.  "If he is one of the ordinary little staf
f dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguar
d, but if he wishes to stay with me, let him... he'll be of use here if he's a br
ave officer," thought Bagration. Prince Andrew, without replying, asked the princ
e's permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces, s
o as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order. The officer on d
uty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who
 was fond of speaking French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince 
Andrew.  On all sides they saw rainsoaked officers with dejected faces who seemed
 to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches, and fencing from 
the village.  "There now, Prince! We can't stop those fellows," said the staff of
ficer pointing to the soldiers. "The officers don't keep them in hand. And there,
" he pointed to a sutler's tent, "they crowd in and sit. This morning I turned th
em all out and now look, it's full again. I must go there, Prince, and scare them
 a bit. It won't take a moment."  "Yes, let's go in and I will get myself a roll 
and some cheese," said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.  "
Why didn't you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you something."  They dis
mounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and weary faces, wer
e sitting at the table eating and drinking.  "Now what does this mean, gentlemen?
" said the staff officer, in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the s
ame thing more than once. "You know it won't do to leave your posts like this. Th
e prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you, Captain," and he
 turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots he had gi
ven them to the canteen keeper to dry, in only his stockings, rose when they ente
red, smiling not altogether comfortably.  "Well, aren't you ashamed of yourself, 
Captain Tushin?" he continued. "One would think that as an artillery officer you 
would set a good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be 
sounded and you'll be in a pretty position without your boots!" The staff officer
 smiled. "Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of you, all!" he added in a
 tone of command.  Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artille
ry officer Tushin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to t
he other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes from Princ
e Andrew to the staff officer.  "The soldiers say it feels easier without boots,"
 said Captain Tushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishi
ng to adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his jest was 
unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.  "Kindly return to your post
s," said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity.  Prince Andrew glanced
 again at the artillery officer's small figure. There was something peculiar abou
t it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic, but extremely attractive.  The staff offic
er and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.  Having ridden beyond the 
village, continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regi
ments, they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug
 clay of which showed up red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt slee
ves despite the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants 
spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by un
seen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at the entrenchment, an
d went on again. Just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers, continual
ly replaced by others, who ran from the entrenchment. They had to hold their nose
s and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these 
latrines.  "Voila l'agrement des camps, monsieur le Prince," * said the staff off
icer.       * "This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince."   They rode up the o
pposite hill. From there the French could already be seen. Prince Andrew stopped 
and began examining the position.  "That's our battery," said the staff officer i
ndicating the highest point. "It's in charge of the queer fellow we saw without h
is boots. You can see everything from there let's go there, Prince."  "Thank you 
very much, I will go on alone," said Prince Andrew, wishing to rid himself of thi
s staff officer's company, "please don't trouble yourself further."  The staff of
ficer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.  The farther forward and n
earer the enemy he went, the more orderly and cheerful were the troops. The great
est disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morn
ing on the Znaim road seven miles away from the French. At Grunth also some appre
hension and alarm could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French 
lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in their 
greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company officers were co
unting the men, poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him t
o hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs an
d brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter around the
 fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or me
nding boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers. In 
one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steamin
g boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in
 a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter, had been tasted
.  Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka, crowded roun
d a pockmarked, broadshouldered sergeant major who, tilting a keg, filled one aft
er another the canteen lids held out to him. The soldiers lifted the canteen lids
 to their lips with reverential faces, emptied them, rolling the vodka in their m
ouths, and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions, licki
ng their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces
 were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampmen
t, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of t
hem would be left on the field. After passing a chasseur regiment and in the line
s of the Kiev grenadiersfine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairsnear the s
helter of the regimental commander, higher than and different from the others, Pr
ince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked 
man. Two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and s
triking him regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally. A stout maj
or was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the screams kept repeating 
 "It's a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must be honest, honorable, and br
ave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him, he's a scoundrel. Go on
! Go on!"  So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural 
screams, continued.  "Go on, go on!" said the major.  A young officer with a bewi
ldered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked rou
nd inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by.  Prince Andrew, having reached the 
front line, rode along it. Our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on
 the right and left flanks, but in the center where the men with a flag of truce 
had passed that morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see o
ne another's faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers who formed the 
picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers who, jesting and la
ughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.  Since early morningdespite an i
njunction not to approach the picket linethe officers had been unable to keep sig
htseers away. The soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a cur
iosity, no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sightseers and g
rew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look at the Fren
ch.  "Look! Look there!" one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a Russian
 musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and
 excitedly talking to a French grenadier. "Hark to him jabbering! Fine, isn't it?
 It's all the Frenchy can do to keep up with him. There now, Sidorov!"  "Wait a b
it and listen. It's fine!" answered Sidorov, who was considered an adept at Frenc
h.  The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dolokhov. Prince Andrew recogni
zed him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. Dolokhov had come from the l
eft flank where their regiment was stationed, with his captain.  "Now then, go on
, go on!" incited the officer, bending forward and trying not to lose a word of t
he speech which was incomprehensible to him. "More, please more! What's he saying
?"  Dolokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot dispute with
 the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the campaign. The French
man, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was trying to prove that the Russ
ians had surrendered and had fled all the way from Ulm, while Dolokhov maintained
 that the Russians had not surrendered but had beaten the French.  "We have order
s to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off," said Dolokhov.  "Only take 
care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!" said the French grenadier.  The
 French onlookers and listeners laughed.  "We'll make you dance as we did under S
uvorov...," * said Dolokhov.       * "On vous fera danser."   "Qu' estce qu'il ch
ante?" * asked a Frenchman.       * "What's he singing about?"   "It's ancient hi
story," said another, guessing that it referred to a former war. "The Emperor wil
l teach your Suvara as he has taught the others..."  "Bonaparte..." began Dolokho
v, but the Frenchman interrupted him.  "Not Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! Sacre n
om...!" cried he angrily.  "The devil skin your Emperor."  And Dolokhov swore at 
him in coarse soldier's Russian and shouldering his musket walked away.  "Let us 
go, Ivan Lukich," he said to the captain.  "Ah, that's the way to talk French," s
aid the picket soldiers. "Now, Sidorov, you have a try!"  Sidorov, turning to the
 French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast "Kari, mala, ta
fa, safi, muter, Kaska," he said, trying to give an expressive intonation to his 
voice.  "Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!" came peals of such healthy and go
odhumored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French involuntarily, s
o much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets, expl
ode the ammunition, and all return home as quickly as possible.  But the guns rem
ained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as m
enacingly, and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before.      CHAPT
ER XVI   Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince Andr
ew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the w
hole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped beside the farthest of 
the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and
 down he stood at attention when the officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his m
easured, monotonous pacing. Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther 
back picket ropes and artillerymen's bonfires. To the left, not far from the fart
hest cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound
 of officers' voices in eager conversation.  It was true that a view over nearly 
the whole Russian position and the greater part of the enemy's opened out from th
is battery. Just facing it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Sch
on Grabern could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops
 amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were evidently in th
e village itself and behind the hill. To the left from that village, amid the smo
ke, was something resembling a battery, but it was impossible to see it clearly w
ith the naked eye. Our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dom
inated the French position. Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthes
t point the dragoons. In the center, where Tushin's battery stood and from which 
Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most direct descent
 and ascent to the brook separating us from Schon Grabern. On the left our troops
 were close to a copse, in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were fel
ling wood. The French line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they could 
easily outflank us on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, m
aking it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took out hi
s notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the position. He made s
ome notes on two points, intending to mention them to Bagration. His idea was, fi
rst, to concentrate all the artillery in the center, and secondly, to withdraw th
e cavalry to the other side of the dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the comm
ander in chief, closely following the mass movements and general orders, and cons
tantly studying historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself
 the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He imagined onl
y important possibilities "If the enemy attacks the right flank," he said to hims
elf, "the Kiev grenadiers and the Podolsk chasseurs must hold their position till
 reserves from the center come up. In that case the dragoons could successfully m
ake a flank counterattack. If they attack our center we, having the center batter
y on this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and retreat
 to the dip by echelons." So he reasoned.... All the time he had been beside the 
gun, he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly, but as often happens had
 not understood a word of what they were saying. Suddenly, however, he was struck
 by a voice coming from the shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not b
ut listen.  "No, friend," said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a f
amiliar voice, "what I say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond dea
th, none of us would be afraid of it. That's so, friend."  Another, a younger voi
ce, interrupted him "Afraid or not, you can't escape it anyhow."  "All the same, 
one is afraid! Oh, you clever people," said a third manly voice interrupting them
 both. "Of course you artillery men are very wise, because you can take everythin
g along with youvodka and snacks."  And the owner of the manly voice, evidently a
n infantry officer, laughed.  "Yes, one is afraid," continued the first speaker, 
he of the familiar voice. "One is afraid of the unknown, that's what it is. Whate
ver we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is no sky but onl
y an atmosphere."  The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.  "Wel
l, stand us some of your herb vodka, Tushin," it said.  "Why," thought Prince And
rew, "that's the captain who stood up in the sutler's hut without his boots." He 
recognized the agreeable, philosophizing voice with pleasure.  "Some herb vodka? 
Certainly!" said Tushin. "But still, to conceive a future life..."  He did not fi
nish. Just then there was a whistle in the air nearer and nearer, faster and loud
er, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it had not finished saying what was n
ecessary, thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force, throwing 
up a mass of earth. The ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact.  And immed
iately Tushin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind, intelli
gent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly 
voice, a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company, buttoning up hi
s coat as he ran.      CHAPTER XVII   Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew ling
ered with the battery, looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. H
is eyes ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto motion
less masses of the French now swayed and that there really was a battery to their
 left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two mounted Frenchmen, probably 
adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A small but distinctly visible enemy colum
n was moving down the hill, probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of t
he first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a r
eport. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back to 
Grunth to find Prince Bagration. He heard the cannonade behind him growing louder
 and more frequent. Evidently our guns had begun to reply. From the bottom of the
 slope, where the parleys had taken place, came the report of musketry.  Lemarroi
s had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte's stern letter, and Murat, humiliat
ed and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once moved his forces to attack the c
enter and outflank both the Russian wings, hoping before evening and before the a
rrival of the Emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.
  "It has begun. Here it is!" thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood rush to hi
s heart. "But where and how will my Toulon present itself?"  Passing between the 
companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour b
efore, he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and ge
tting their muskets ready, and on all their faces he recognized the same eagernes
s that filled his heart. "It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!" was 
what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.  Before he had reac
hed the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw, in the light of the dull a
utumn evening, mounted men coming toward him. The foremost, wearing a Cossack clo
ak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse, was Prince Bagration. Prince Andrew
 stopped, waiting for him to come up Prince Bagration reined in his horse and rec
ognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew t
old him what he had seen.  The feeling, "It has begun! Here it is!" was seen even
 on Prince Bagration's hard brown face with its halfclosed, dull, sleepy eyes. Pr
ince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he cou
ld tell what, if anything, this man was thinking and feeling at that moment. "Is 
there anything at all behind that impassive face?" Prince Andrew asked himself as
 he looked. Prince Bagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince 
Andrew told him, and said, "Very good!" in a tone that seemed to imply that every
thing that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen. P
rince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke quickly. Prince Bagration,
 uttering his words with an Oriental accent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to 
impress the fact that there was no need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a 
trot in the direction of Tushin's battery. Prince Andrew followed with the suite.
 Behind Prince Bagration rode an officer of the suite, the prince's personal adju
tant, Zherkov, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobta
iled horse, and a civilianan accountant who had asked permission to be present at
 the battle out of curiosity. The accountant, a stout, fullfaced man, looked arou
nd him with a naive smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance amon
g the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on his h
orse with a convoy officer's saddle.  "He wants to see a battle," said Zherkov to
 Bolkonski, pointing to the accountant, "but he feels a pain in the pit of his st
omach already."  "Oh, leave off!" said the accountant with a beaming but rather c
unning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherkov's joke, and pu
rposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.  "It is very strange, mon M
onsieur Prince," said the staff officer. He remembered that in French there is so
me peculiar way of addressing a prince, but could not get it quite right.  By thi
s time they were all approaching Tushin's battery, and a ball struck the ground i
n front of them.  "What's that that has fallen?" asked the accountant with a naiv
e smile.  "A French pancake," answered Zherkov.  "So that's what they hit with?" 
asked the accountant. "How awful!"  He seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had 
hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling 
which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft... ffflop! and a Cossack, ri
ding a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with his
 horse. Zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their ho
rses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack, and examined him with atte
ntive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled.  Prince Bag
ration screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the cause of the confusion,
 turned away with indifference, as if to say, "Is it worth while noticing trifles
?" He reined in his horse with the case of a skillful rider and, slightly bending
 over, disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak. It was an oldfashioned
 saber of a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of 
Suvorov giving his saber to Bagration in Italy, and the recollection was particul
arly pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery at which Prince Andrew
 had been when he examined the battlefield.  "Whose company?" asked Prince Bagrat
ion of an artilleryman standing by the ammunition wagon.  He asked, "Whose compan
y?" but he really meant, "Are you frightened here?" and the artilleryman understo
od him.  "Captain Tushin's, your excellency!" shouted the redhaired, freckled gun
ner in a merry voice, standing to attention.  "Yes, yes," muttered Bagration as i
f considering something, and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.  As
 he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite, and in
 the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the gunners who had se
ized it straining to roll it quickly back to its former position. A huge, broadsh
ouldered gunner, Number One, holding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the whe
el while Number Two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon's mouth. 
The short, roundshouldered Captain Tushin, stumbling over the tail of the gun car
riage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out shading his eyes w
ith his small hand.  "Lift it two lines more and it will be just right," cried he
 in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill suited to his 
weak figure. "Number Two!" he squeaked. "Fire, Medvedev!"  Bagration called to hi
m, and Tushin, raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gestur
e not at all like a military salute but like a priest's benediction, approached t
he general. Though Tushin's guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he wa
s firing incendiary balls at the village of Schon Grabern visible just opposite, 
in front of which large masses of French were advancing.  No one had given Tushin
 orders where and at what to fire, but after consulting his sergeant major, Zakha
rchenko, for whom he had great respect, he had decided that it would be a good th
ing to set fire to the village. "Very good!" said Bagration in reply to the offic
er's report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended bef
ore him. The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the height on which 
the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the rivulet flowed, the soul
stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard, and much farther to the rig
ht beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to Bagration a Frenc
h column that was outflanking us. To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent
 wood. Prince Bagration ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to rein
force the right flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince 
that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain without support. Prince
 Bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence.
 It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer's remark was just and that really no
 answer could be made to it. But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a me
ssage from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense mass
es of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder
 and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagration bowed his head in 
sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjut
ant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French. But this adjutant returned 
half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already r
etreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and
 he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters int
o the wood.  "Very good!" said Bagration.  As he was leaving the battery, firing 
was heard on the left also, and as it was too far to the left flank for him to ha
ve time to go there himself, Prince Bagration sent Zherkov to tell the general in
 command the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutuzov at Braunau that he m
ust retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear, as the right fl
ank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy's attack very long. About T
ushin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten
. Prince Andrew listened attentively to Bagration's colloquies with the commandin
g officers and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders
 were really given, but that Prince Bagration tried to make it appear that everyt
hing done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was
 done, if not by his direct command, at least in accord with his intentions. Prin
ce Andrew noticed, however, that though what happened was due to chance and was i
ndependent of the commander's will, owing to the tact Bagration showed, his prese
nce was very valuable. Officers who approached him with disturbed countenances be
came calm soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his pres
ence, and were evidently anxious to display their courage before him.      CHAPTE
R XVIII   Prince Bagration, having reached the highest point of our right flank, 
began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on accoun
t of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to the hollow the less 
they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield. The
y began to meet wounded men. One with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragge
d along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms. There was a gurgle in h
is throat and he was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat
 or mouth. Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket, groani
ng aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while blood from it was s
treaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had that moment been wounded and
 his face showed fear rather than suffering. Crossing a road they descended a ste
ep incline and saw several men lying on the ground they also met a crowd of soldi
ers some of whom were unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing h
eavily, and despite the general's presence were talking loudly and gesticulating.
 In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and
 an officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after the crowd of retrea
ting soldiers, ordering them back. Bagration rode up to the ranks along which sho
ts crackled now here and now there, drowning the sound of voices and the shouts o
f command. The whole air reeked with smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers wer
e blackened with it. Some were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the 
touchpans or taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though 
who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind t
o carry away. A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard. "What
 is this?" thought Prince Andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers. "It can't be 
an attack, for they are not moving it can't be a squarefor they are not drawn up 
for that."  The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeblelooking old man with a p
leasant smilehis eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes, giving him a 
mild expression, rode up to Bagration and welcomed him as a host welcomes an hono
red guest. He reported that his regiment had been attacked by French cavalry and 
that, though the attack had been repulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He
 said the attack had been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what
 had occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what had ha
ppened during that halfhour to the troops entrusted to him, and could not say wit
h certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken 
up. All he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began
 flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had sho
uted "Cavalry!" and our men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the 
cavalry which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the hollo
w and were firing at our men. Prince Bagration bowed his head as a sign that this
 was exactly what he had desired and expected. Turning to his adjutant he ordered
 him to bring down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just p
assed. Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on Prince Bagration's f
ace at this moment. It expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on
 the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the wa
ter. The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation of prof
ound thought. The round, steady, hawk's eyes looked before him eagerly and rather
 disdainfully, not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and
 measured.  The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagration, entreating 
him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were. "Please, your e
xcellency, for God's sake!" he kept saying, glancing for support at an officer of
 the suite who turned away from him. "There, you see!" and he drew attention to t
he bullets whistling, singing, and hissing continually around them. He spoke in t
he tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has pic
ked up an ax "We are used to it, but you, sir, will blister your hands." He spoke
 as if those bullets could not kill him, and his halfclosed eyes gave still more 
persuasiveness to his words. The staff officer joined in the colonel's appeals, b
ut Bagration did not reply he only gave an order to cease firing and reform, so a
s to give room for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the cur
tain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began to mo
ve from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the hill opposite, wi
th the French moving about on it, opened out before them. All eyes fastened invol
untarily on this French column advancing against them and winding down over the u
neven ground. One could already see the soldiers' shaggy caps, distinguish the of
ficers from the men, and see the standard flapping against its staff.  "They marc
h splendidly," remarked someone in Bagration's suite.  The head of the column had
 already descended into the hollow. The clash would take place on this side of it
...  The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and m
oved to the right from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came two battalions of
 the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had reached Bagration, the weight
y tread of the mass of men marching in step could be heard. On their left flank, 
nearest to Bagration, marched a company commander, a fine roundfaced man, with a 
stupid and happy expressionthe same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At
 that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would
 appear as he passed the commander.  With the selfsatisfaction of a man on parade
, he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himse
lf to his full height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the 
heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close to h
is leg a narrow unsheathed sword small, curved, and not like a real weapon and lo
oked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing step, hi
s whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as if all the powers of his soul w
ere concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner, and feelin
g that he was doing it well he was happy. "Left... left... left..." he seemed to 
repeat to himself at each alternate step and in time to this, with stern but vari
ed faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in ste
p, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself a
t each alternate step, "Left... left... left..." A fat major skirted a bush, puff
ing and falling out of step a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing ala
rm at his defection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A canno
n ball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of Bagration and his suite, and fel
l into the column to the measure of "Left... left!" "Close up!" came the company 
commander's voice in jaunty tones. The soldiers passed in a semicircle round some
thing where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommission
ed officer who had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, fal
ling into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous silence a
nd the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one seemed to hear lef
t... left... left.  "Well done, lads!" said Prince Bagration.  "Glad to do our be
st, your ex'lenlency!" came a confused shout from the ranks. A morose soldier mar
ching on the left turned his eyes on Bagration as he shouted, with an expression 
that seemed to say "We know that ourselves!" Another, without looking round, as t
hough fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.  The orde
r was given to halt and down knapsacks.  Bagration rode round the ranks that had 
marched past him and dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and han
ded over his felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of
 the French column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.  "Fo
rward, with God!" said Bagration, in a resolute, sonorous voice, turning for a mo
ment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms, he went forward uneasily 
over the rough field with the awkward gait of a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt th
at an invisible power was leading him forward, and experienced great happiness.  
The French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagration, could clea
rly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their faces. He distinct
ly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered legs and turnedout toes, climbed 
the hill with difficulty. Prince Bagration gave no further orders and silently co
ntinued to walk on in front of the ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang ou
t from the French, smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots 
sounded. Several of our men fell, among them the roundfaced officer who had march
ed so gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first report was heard, Bagra
tion looked round and shouted, "Hurrah!"  "Hurrahah!ah!" rang a longdrawn shout f
rom our ranks, and passing Bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irr
egular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.      CHA
PTER XIX   The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right fla
nk. In the center Tushin's forgotten battery, which had managed to set fire to th
e Schon Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The French were putting out 
the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus gave us time to retreat. The reti
rement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was h
urried and noisy, but the different companies did not get mixed. But our leftwhic
h consisted of the Azov and Podolsk infantry and the Pavlograd hussarswas simulta
neously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under Lannes and was th
rown into confusion. Bagration had sent Zherkov to the general commanding that le
ft flank with orders to retreat immediately.  Zherkov, not removing his hand from
 his cap, turned his horse about and galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagr
ation than his courage failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where 
it was dangerous.  Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the front w
here the firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they co
uld not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.  The command of the left f
lank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment Kutuzov had reviewed 
at Braunau and in which Dolokhov was serving as a private. But the command of the
 extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the Pavlograd regiment 
in which Rostov was serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders wer
e much exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on the r
ight flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged in discussion with
 the sole object of offending one another. But the regiments, both cavalry and in
fantry, were by no means ready for the impending action. From privates to general
 they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the c
avalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood.  "He higher iss dan I
 in rank," said the German colonel of the hussars, flushing and addressing an adj
utant who had ridden up, "so let him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my h
ussars... Bugler, sount ze retreat!"  But haste was becoming imperative. Cannon a
nd musketry, mingling together, thundered on the right and in the center, while t
he capotes of Lannes' sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and fo
rming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in command of the i
nfantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and having mounted drew himself u
p very straight and tall and rode to the Pavlograd commander. The commanders met 
with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts.  "Once again, Colon
el," said the general, "I can't leave half my men in the wood. I beg of you, I be
g of you," he repeated, "to occupy the position and prepare for an attack."  "I p
eg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!" suddenly replied the 
irate colonel. "If you vere in the cavalry..."  "I am not in the cavalry, Colonel
, but I am a Russian general and if you are not aware of the fact..."  "Quite ava
re, your excellency," suddenly shouted the colonel, touching his horse and turnin
g purple in the face. "Vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis po
sition iss no goot? I don't vish to destroy my men for your pleasure!"  "You forg
et yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure and I won't allow it t
o be said!"  Taking the colonel's outburst as a challenge to his courage, the gen
eral expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front line, as if t
heir differences would be settled there amongst the bullets. They reached the fro
nt, several bullets sped over them, and they halted in silence. There was nothing
 fresh to be seen from the line, for from where they had been before it had been 
evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken gro
und, as well as that the French were outflanking our left. The general and colone
l looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks prepari
ng for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other. Both
 passed the examination successfully. As there was nothing to be said, and neithe
r wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leav
e the range of fire, they would have remained there for a long time testing each 
other's courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry 
and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The French had attacked the m
en collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible for the hussars to ret
reat with the infantry. They were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by
 the French. However inconvenient the position, it was now necessary to attack in
 order to cut away through for themselves.  The squadron in which Rostov was serv
ing had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as a
t the Enns bridge, there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and agai
n that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fearresembling the line separati
ng the living from the deadlay between them. All were conscious of this unseen li
ne, and the question whether they would cross it or not, and how they would cross
 it, agitated them all.  The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply t
o questions put to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on 
having his own way, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor o
f an attack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang out and the 
sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards. Still no one moved. The t
roops of the left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that the commander did 
not himself know what to do, and this irresolution communicated itself to the men
.  "If only they would be quick!" thought Rostov, feeling that at last the time h
ad come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from hi
s fellow hussars.  "Fo'ward, with God, lads!" rang out Denisov's voice. "At a two
t fo'ward!"  The horses' croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at t
he reins and started of his own accord.  Before him, on the right, Rostov saw the
 front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could no
t see distinctly but took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off
.  "Faster!" came the word of command, and Rostov felt Rook's flanks drooping as 
he broke into a gallop.  Rostov anticipated his horse's movements and became more
 and more elated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been
 in the middle of the line that had seemed so terribleand now he had crossed that
 line and not only was there nothing terrible, but everything was becoming more a
nd more happy and animated. "Oh, how I will slash at him!" thought Rostov, grippi
ng the hilt of his saber.  "Huraaaah!" came a roar of voices. "Let anyone come my
 way now," thought Rostov driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a ful
l gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was already visible.
 Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron. Rostov 
raised his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant the trooper Nikitenko, who
 was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and Rostov felt as in a dream that he c
ontinued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same sp
ot. From behind him Bondarchuk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked 
angrily at him. Bondarchuk's horse swerved and galloped past.  "How is it I am no
t moving? I have fallen, I am killed!" Rostov asked and answered at the same inst
ant. He was alone in the middle of a field. Instead of the moving horses and huss
ars' backs, he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble ar
ound him. There was warm blood under his arm. "No, I am wounded and the horse is 
killed." Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his rider's le
g. Blood was flowing from his head he struggled but could not rise. Rostov also t
ried to rise but fell back, his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle.
 Where our men were, and where the French, he did not know. There was no one near
.  Having disentangled his leg, he rose. "Where, on which side, was now the line 
that had so sharply divided the two armies?" he asked himself and could not answe
r. "Can something bad have happened to me?" he wondered as he got up and at that 
moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. T
he wrist felt as if it were not his. He examined his hand carefully, vainly tryin
g to find blood on it. "Ah, here are people coming," he thought joyfully, seeing 
some men running toward him. "They will help me!" In front came a man wearing a s
trange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a hooked nose. Then c
ame two more, and many more running behind. One of them said something strange, n
ot in Russian. In among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Ru
ssian hussar. He was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind hi
m.  "It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will take me to
o? Who are these men?" thought Rostov, scarcely believing his eyes. "Can they be 
French?" He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and though but a moment before h
e had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now 
seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes. "Who are they? Why are they r
unning? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone is so fon
d of?" He remembered his mother's love for him, and his family's, and his friends
', and the enemy's intention to kill him seemed impossible. "But perhaps they may
 do it!" For more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing
 the situation. The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already
 so close that the expression of his face could be seen. And the excited, alien f
ace of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath, and running so lig
htly, frightened Rostov. He seized his pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it
 at the Frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes. He did not now ru
n with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridg
e, but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, 
that of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly lea
ping the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show a
t catchplay, now and then turning his goodnatured, pale, young face to look back.
 A shudder of terror went through him "No, better not look," he thought, but havi
ng reached the bushes he glanced round once more. The French had fallen behind, a
nd just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and, turning, 
shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back. Rostov paused. "No, there's s
ome mistake," thought he. "They can't have wanted to kill me." But at the same ti
me, his left arm felt as heavy as if a seventypound weight were tied to it. He co
uld run no more. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostov closed his eyes 
and stooped down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered his 
last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and reached t
he bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.      CHAPTER XX   The in
fantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran o
ut of it, the different companies getting mixed, and retreated as a disorderly cr
owd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the senseless cry, "Cut off!" that is so t
errible in battle, and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic
.  "Surrounded! Cut off? We're lost!" shouted the fugitives.  The moment he heard
 the firing and the cry from behind, the general realized that something dreadful
 had happened to his regiment, and the thought that he, an exemplary officer of m
any years' service who had never been to blame, might be held responsible at head
quarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the rec
alcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above all quite forg
etting the danger and all regard for selfpreservation, he clutched the crupper of
 his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to the regiment under a hail of bul
lets which fell around, but fortunately missed him. His one desire was to know wh
at was happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made o
ne, so that he, an exemplary officer of twentytwo years' service, who had never b
een censured, should not be held to blame.  Having galloped safely through the Fr
ench, he reached a field behind the copse across which our men, regardless of ord
ers, were running and descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation whic
h decides the fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldier
s attend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him, contin
ue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to th
e soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness 
to his former self, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued 
to run, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying orders. The moral hesitation
 which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic.  The gen
eral had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and st
opped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that moment the French who were 
attacking, suddenly and without any apparent reason, ran back and disappeared fro
m the outskirts, and Russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was
 Timokhin's company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having
 lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly. Timokhin, armed
 only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such ma
d, drunken determination that, taken by surprise, the French had thrown down thei
r muskets and run. Dolokhov, running beside Timokhin, killed a Frenchman at close
 quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering French officer by his colla
r. Our fugitives returned, the battalions reformed, and the French who had nearly
 cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed. Our reserve units were 
able to join up, and the fight was at an end. The regimental commander and Major 
Ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies pass by th
em, when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander's stirrup, almost leani
ng against him. The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsa
ck or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition pouch w
as slung. He had an officer's sword in his hand. The soldier was pale, his blue e
yes looked impudently into the commander's face, and his lips were smiling. Thoug
h the commander was occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonomov, he could n
ot help taking notice of the soldier.  "Your excellency, here are two trophies," 
said Dolokhov, pointing to the French sword and pouch. "I have taken an officer p
risoner. I stopped the company." Dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spo
ke in abrupt sentences. "The whole company can bear witness. I beg you will remem
ber this, your excellency!"  "All right, all right," replied the commander, and t
urned to Major Ekonomov.  But Dolokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief
 around his head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.  "A 
bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your excellency!"   Tushin's ba
ttery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did Prince Bagrat
ion, still hearing the cannonade in the center, send his orderly staff officer, a
nd later Prince Andrew also, to order the battery to retire as quickly as possibl
e. When the supports attached to Tushin's battery had been moved away in the midd
le of the action by someone's order, the battery had continued firing and was onl
y not captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone coul
d have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns. On the 
contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the French to suppose that her
ein the centerthe main Russian forces were concentrated. Twice they had attempted
 to attack this point, but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot fro
m the four isolated guns on the hillock.  Soon after Prince Bagration had left hi
m, Tushin had succeeded in setting fire to Schon Grabern.  "Look at them scurryin
g! It's burning! Just see the smoke! Fine! Grand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!" 
exclaimed the artillerymen, brightening up.  All the guns, without waiting for or
ders, were being fired in the direction of the conflagration. As if urging each o
ther on, the soldiers cried at each shot "Fine! That's good! Look at it... Grand!
" The fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns that 
had advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge for this failu
re, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them a
t Tushin's battery.  In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck 
in successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this batter
y when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one knocking over two 
horses and another tearing off a munitionwagon driver's leg. Their spirits once r
oused were, however, not diminished, but only changed character. The horses were 
replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, an
d the four guns were turned against the tengun battery. Tushin's companion office
r had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen
 of the forty men of the guns' crews had been disabled, but the artillerymen were
 still as merry and lively as ever. Twice they noticed the French appearing below
 them, and then they fired grapeshot at them.  Little Tushin, moving feebly and a
wkwardly, kept telling his orderly to "refill my pipe for that one!" and then, sc
attering sparks from it, ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look
 at the French.  "Smack at 'em, lads!" he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wh
eels and working the screws himself.  Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant r
eports which always made him jump, Tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran 
from gun to gun, now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about re
placing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his fee
ble voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and more animated. 
Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight, 
shouting angrily at the men who, as is always the case, hesitated about lifting t
he injured or dead. The soldiers, for the most part handsome fellows and, as is a
lways the case in an artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as 
broad as their officerall looked at their commander like children in an embarrass
ing situation, and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs.
  Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity, 
Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear, and the thought
 that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him. On the contrary,
 he became more and more elated. It seemed to him that it was a very long time ag
o, almost a day, since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and 
that the corner of the field he stood on was wellknown and familiar ground. Thoug
h he thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the best of
 officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to feverish delirium o
r drunkenness.  From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle
 and thud of the enemy's cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces of t
he crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men and horses, f
rom the little puffs of smoke on the enemy's side always followed by a ball flyin
g past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a horse, from the sight of all these
 things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at tha
t moment afforded him pleasure. The enemy's guns were in his fancy not guns but p
ipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.  "There... he
's puffing again," muttered Tushin to himself, as a small cloud rose from the hil
l and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind.  "Now look out for the ball.
.. we'll throw it back."  "What do you want, your honor?" asked an artilleryman, 
standing close by, who heard him muttering.  "Nothing... only a shell..." he answ
ered.  "Come along, our Matvevna!" he said to himself. "Matvevna" * was the name 
his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which was large and of an old 
pattern. The French swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants. In that wo
rld, the handsome drunkard Number One of the second gun's crew was "uncle" Tushin
 looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movem
ent. The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now increasi
ng, seemed like someone's breathing. He listened intently to the ebb and flow of 
these sounds.       * Daughter of Matthew.   "Ah! Breathing again, breathing!" he
 muttered to himself.  He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man wh
o was throwing cannon balls at the French with both hands.  "Now then, Matvevna, 
dear old lady, don't let me down!" he was saying as he moved from the gun, when a
 strange, unfamiliar voice called above his head "Captain Tushin! Captain!"  Tush
in turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned him out of the
 booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice  "Are you mad? You have twic
e been ordered to retreat, and you..."  "Why are they down on me?" thought Tushin
, looking in alarm at his superior.  "I... don't..." he muttered, holding up two 
fingers to his cap. "I..."  But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted t
o say. A cannon ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his h
orse. He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball sto
pped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.  "Retire! All to retire!" he shou
ted from a distance.  The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived w
ith the same order.  It was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to
 the space where Tushin's guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a bro
ken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses. Blood was gush
ing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay several dead men. One ba
ll after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run d
own his spine. But the mere thought of being afraid roused him again. "I cannot b
e afraid," thought he, and dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the ord
er and did not leave the battery. He decided to have the guns removed from their 
positions and withdrawn in his presence. Together with Tushin, stepping across th
e bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended to the removal of
 the guns.  "A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off," said an art
illeryman to Prince Andrew. "Not like your honor!"  Prince Andrew said nothing to
 Tushin. They were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another. When having
 limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they be
gan moving down the hill one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind, Prin
ce Andrew rode up to Tushin.  "Well, till we meet again..." he said, holding out 
his hand to Tushin.  "Goodby, my dear fellow," said Tushin. "Dear soul! Goodby, m
y dear fellow!" and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes.      
CHAPTER XXI   The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke
, hung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing dark and the g
low of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The cannonade was dying down,
 but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer. A
s soon as Tushin with his guns, continually driving round or coming upon wounded 
men, was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some 
of the staff, among them the staff officer and Zherkov, who had been twice sent t
o Tushin's battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one another, they all g
ave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed, reprimanding and reproaching h
im. Tushin gave no orders, and, silentlyfearing to speak because at every word he
 felt ready to weep without knowing whyrode behind on his artillery nag. Though t
he orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves after troo
ps and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty infantry officer who jus
t before the battle had rushed out of Tushin's wattle shed was laid, with a bulle
t in his stomach, on "Matvevna's" carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussa
r cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to Tushin and asked for a se
at.  "Captain, for God's sake! I've hurt my arm," he said timidly. "For God's sak
e... I can't walk. For God's sake!"  It was plain that this cadet had already rep
eatedly asked for a lift and been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voic
e.  "Tell them to give me a seat, for God's sake!"  "Give him a seat," said Tushi
n. "Lay a cloak for him to sit on, lad," he said, addressing his favorite soldier
. "And where is the wounded officer?"  "He has been set down. He died," replied s
omeone.  "Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak, Ant
onov."  The cadet was Rostov. With one hand he supported the other he was pale an
d his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on "Matvevna," the gun fr
om which they had removed the dead officer. The cloak they spread under him was w
et with blood which stained his breeches and arm.  "What, are you wounded, my lad
?" said Tushin, approaching the gun on which Rostov sat.  "No, it's a sprain."  "
Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?" inquired Tushin.  "It was the offic
er, your honor, stained it," answered the artilleryman, wiping away the blood wit
h his coat sleeve, as if apologizing for the state of his gun.  It was all that t
hey could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry, and having reache
d the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It had grown so dark that one could no
t distinguish the uniforms ten paces off, and the firing had begun to subside. Su
ddenly, near by on the right, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of sh
ot gleamed in the darkness. This was the last French attack and was met by soldie
rs who had sheltered in the village houses. They all rushed out of the village ag
ain, but Tushin's guns could not move, and the artillerymen, Tushin, and the cade
t exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate. The firing died down and s
oldiers, talking eagerly, streamed out of a side street.  "Not hurt, Petrov?" ask
ed one.  "We've given it 'em hot, mate! They won't make another push now," said a
nother.  "You couldn't see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows! Nothing c
ould be seen. Pitchdark, brother! Isn't there something to drink?"  The French ha
d been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in the complete darkness T
ushin's guns moved forward, surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame.  In
 the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in on
e direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels. Am
id the general rumble, the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly 
heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night. The gloom that enveloped
 the army was filled with their groans, which seemed to melt into one with the da
rkness of the night. After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode 
past on a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing "What 
did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?" came eager questions fr
om all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report s
pread that they were ordered to halt evidently those in front had halted. All rem
ained where they were in the middle of the muddy road.  Fires were lighted and th
e talk became more audible. Captain Tushin, having given orders to his company, s
ent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down 
by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road. Rostov, too, dragged himself t
o the fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole body.
 Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by an excruciating 
pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory position. He kept closin
g his eyes and then again looking at the fire, which seemed to him dazzlingly red
, and at the feeble, roundshouldered figure of Tushin who was sitting crosslegged
 like a Turk beside him. Tushin's large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with s
ympathy and commiseration on Rostov, who saw that Tushin with his whole heart wis
hed to help him but could not.  From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk 
of the infantry, who were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. Th
e sound of voices, the tramping feet, the horses' hoofs moving in mud, the crackl
ing of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.  It was no lon
ger, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the gloom, but a dark sea sw
elling and gradually subsiding after a storm. Rostov looked at and listened listl
essly to what passed before and around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squa
tted on his heels, held his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.  "You d
on't mind your honor?" he asked Tushin. "I've lost my company, your honor. I don'
t know where... such bad luck!"  With the soldier, an infantry officer with a ban
daged cheek came up to the bonfire, and addressing Tushin asked him to have the g
uns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed
 to the campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying to s
natch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.  "You picked it up?... 
I dare say! You're very smart!" one of them shouted hoarsely.  Then a thin, pale 
soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band, came up and in angry ton
es asked the artillerymen for water.  "Must one die like a dog?" said he.  Tushin
 told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier ran up, begging a 
little fire for the infantry.  "A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good lu
ck to you, fellow countrymen. Thanks for the firewe'll return it with interest," 
said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.  Next came four soldier
s, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed by the fire. One of them stumb
led.  "Who the devil has put the logs on the road?" snarled he.  "He's deadwhy ca
rry him?" said another.  "Shut up!"  And they disappeared into the darkness with 
their load.  "Still aching?" Tushin asked Rostov in a whisper.  "Yes."  "Your hon
or, you're wanted by the general. He is in the hut here," said a gunner, coming u
p to Tushin.  "Coming, friend."  Tushin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pul
ling it straight, walked away from the fire.  Not far from the artillery campfire
, in a hut that had been prepared for him, Prince Bagration sat at dinner, talkin
g with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old 
man with the halfclosed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the ge
neral who had served blamelessly for twentytwo years, flushed by a glass of vodka
 and the dinner and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherkov, uneasily
 glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed lips and feverish
ly glittering eyes.  In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the Fr
ench, and the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture, shaking his
 head in perplexityperhaps because the banner really interested him, perhaps beca
use it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at a dinner where there was
 no place for him. In the next hut there was a French colonel who had been taken 
prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers were flocking in to look at him. Prince Ba
gration was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the 
action and our losses. The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau w
as informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from th
e wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the French to pass h
im, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the French tr
oops.  "When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was disorganized,
 I stopped in the road and thought 'I'll let them come on and will meet them with
 the fire of the whole battalion'and that's what I did."  The general had so wish
ed to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him 
as if it had really happened. Perhaps it might really have been so? Could one pos
sibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen?  "By the way, 
your excellency, I should inform you," he continuedremembering Dolokhov's convers
ation with Kutuzov and his last interview with the gentlemanranker"that Private D
olokhov, who was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my prese
nce and particularly distinguished himself."  "I saw the Pavlograd hussars attack
 there, your excellency," chimed in Zherkov, looking uneasily around. He had not 
seen the hussars all that day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer.
 "They broke up two squares, your excellency."  Several of those present smiled a
t Zherkov's words, expecting one of his usual jokes, but noticing that what he wa
s saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the day's work, they assumed a
 serious expression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie d
evoid of any foundation. Prince Bagration turned to the old colonel  "Gentlemen, 
I thank you all all arms have behaved heroically infantry, cavalry, and artillery
. How was it that two guns were abandoned in the center?" he inquired, searching 
with his eyes for someone. Prince Bagration did not ask about the guns on the lef
t flank he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning 
of the action. "I think I sent you?" he added, turning to the staff officer on du
ty.  "One was damaged," answered the staff officer, "and the other I can't unders
tand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only just left.... It is tru
e that it was hot there," he added, modestly.  Someone mentioned that Captain Tus
hin was bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent for.  "Oh, but
 you were there?" said Prince Bagration, addressing Prince Andrew.  "Of course, w
e only just missed one another," said the staff officer, with a smile to Bolkonsk
i.  "I had not the pleasure of seeing you," said Prince Andrew, coldly and abrupt
ly.  All were silent. Tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly f
rom behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the generals in the crow
ded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors, he d
id not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it. Several of those pres
ent laughed.  "How was it a gun was abandoned?" asked Bagration, frowning, not so
 much at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom Zherkov laughed lo
udest.  Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt 
and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselv
es to Tushin in all their horror. He had been so excited that he had not thought 
about it until that moment. The officers' laughter confused him still more. He st
ood before Bagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter "
I don't know... your excellency... I had no men... your excellency."  "You might 
have taken some from the covering troops."  Tushin did not say that there were no
 covering troops, though that was perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some o
ther officer into trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagration as a schoolbo
y who has blundered looks at an examiner.  The silence lasted some time. Prince B
agration, apparently not wishing to be severe, found nothing to say the others di
d not venture to intervene. Prince Andrew looked at Tushin from under his brows a
nd his fingers twitched nervously.  "Your excellency!" Prince Andrew broke the si
lence with his abrupt voice, "you were pleased to send me to Captain Tushin's bat
tery. I went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two gu
ns smashed, and no supports at all."  Prince Bagration and Tushin looked with equ
al intentness at Bolkonski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.  "And, if your e
xcellency will allow me to express my opinion," he continued, "we owe today's suc
cess chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of Captain Tu
shin and his company," and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left 
the table.  Prince Bagration looked at Tushin, evidently reluctant to show distru
st in Bolkonski's emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it, bent 
his head, and told Tushin that he could go. Prince Andrew went out with him.  "Th
ank you you saved me, my dear fellow!" said Tushin.  Prince Andrew gave him a loo
k, but said nothing and went away. He felt sad and depressed. It was all so stran
ge, so unlike what he had hoped.   "Who are they? Why are they here? What do they
 want? And when will all this end?" thought Rostov, looking at the changing shado
ws before him. The pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible dro
wsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the impression of 
those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain. I
t was they, these soldierswounded and unwoundedit was they who were crushing, wei
ghing down, and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm a
nd shoulder. To rid himself of them he closed his eyes.  For a moment he dozed, b
ut in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream his mothe
r and her large white hand, Sonya's thin little shoulders, Natasha's eyes and lau
ghter, Denisov with his voice and mustache, and Telyanin and all that affair with
 Telyanin and Bogdanich. That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the 
harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly, in
cessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction. H
e tried to get away from them, but they would not for an instant let his shoulder
 move a hair's breadth. It would not acheit would be wellif only they did not pul
l it, but it was impossible to get rid of them.  He opened his eyes and looked up
. The black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal.
 Flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light. Tushin had not returned, t
he doctor had not come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting na
ked at the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.  "Nobody wants m
e!" thought Rostov. "There is no one to help me or pity me. Yet I was once at hom
e, strong, happy, and loved." He sighed and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.  "E
h, is anything hurting you?" asked the soldier, shaking his shirt out over the fi
re, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added "What a lot of men ha
ve been crippled todayfrightful!"  Rostov did not listen to the soldier. He looke
d at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at 
his warm, bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his healt
hy body, and all the affection and care of his family. "And why did I come here?"
 he wondered.  Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remna
nt of Bagration's detachment was reunited to Kutuzov's army.      BOOK THREE 1805
      CHAPTER I   Prince Vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his pl
ans. Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He was mer
ely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit. 
Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself, but which fo
rmed the whole interest of his life, were constantly shaping themselves in his mi
nd, arising from the circumstances and persons he met. Of these plans he had not 
merely one or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves,
 some approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He did not, 
for instance, say to himself "This man now has influence, I must gain his confide
nce and friendship and through him obtain a special grant." Nor did he say to him
self "Pierre is a rich man, I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me th
e forty thousand rubles I need." But when he came across a man of position his in
stinct immediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any premed
itation Prince Vasili took the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter 
him, become intimate with him, and finally make his request.  He had Pierre at ha
nd in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as Gentleman of the Bedchamber, 
which at that time conferred the status of Councilor of State, and insisted on th
e young man accompanying him to Petersburg and staying at his house. With apparen
t absentmindedness, yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right t
hing, Prince Vasili did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had he th
ought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such u
naffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in s
ocial standing. Something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful t
han himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making
 use of people.  Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezukhov and a rich man, 
felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and preo
ccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to sign papers, to 
present himself at government offices, the purpose of which was not clear to him,
 to question his chief steward, to visit his estate near Moscow, and to receive m
any people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would now 
have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them. These different peo
plebusinessmen, relations, and acquaintances alikewere all disposed to treat the 
young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner they were all evidently fir
mly convinced of Pierre's noble qualities. He was always hearing such words as "W
ith your remarkable kindness," or, "With your excellent heart," "You are yourself
 so honorable Count," or, "Were he as clever as you," and so on, till he began si
ncerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence
, the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he re
ally was very kind and intelligent. Even people who had formerly been spiteful to
ward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate. The angry e
ldest princess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll's, had co
me into Pierre's room after the funeral. With drooping eyes and frequent blushes 
she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not no
w feel she had a right to ask him for anything, except only for permission, after
 the blow she had received, to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so 
loved and where she had sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping at
 these words. Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre took 
her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for. From that day the 
eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began knitting a striped scarf fo
r him.  "Do this for my sake, mon cher after all, she had to put up with a great 
deal from the deceased," said Prince Vasili to him, handing him a deed to sign fo
r the princess' benefit.  Prince Vasili had come to the conclusion that it was ne
cessary to throw this bonea bill for thirty thousand rublesto the poor princess t
hat it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid p
ortfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder. T
he younger sisters also became affectionate to him, especially the youngest, the 
pretty one with the mole, who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her 
own confusion when meeting him.  It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone sho
uld like him, and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that
 he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had n
o time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not. He was always bus
y and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication. He felt as though
 he were the center of some important and general movement that something was con
stantly expected of him, that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint 
many people, but if he did this and that, all would be well and he did what was d
emanded of him, but still that happy result always remained in the future.  More 
than anyone else, Prince Vasili took possession of Pierre's affairs and of Pierre
 himself in those early days. From the death of Count Bezukhov he did not let go 
his hold of the lad. He had the air of a man oppressed by business, weary and suf
fering, who yet would not, for pity's sake, leave this helpless youth who, after 
all, was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to 
the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues. During the few days he spent in Mo
scow after the death of Count Bezukhov, he would call Pierre, or go to him himsel
f, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance, as if
 he were adding every time "You know I am overwhelmed with business and it is pur
ely out of charity that I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well 
that what I propose is the only thing possible."  "Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow
 we are off at last," said Prince Vasili one day, closing his eyes and fingering 
Pierre's elbow, speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been
 agreed upon and could not now be altered. "We start tomorrow and I'm giving you 
a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All our important business here is now se
ttled, and I ought to have been off long ago. Here is something I have received f
rom the chancellor. I asked him for you, and you have been entered in the diploma
tic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies 
open before you."  Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these
 words were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career, wish
ed to make some suggestion. But Prince Vasili interrupted him in the special deep
 cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech, which he use
d in extreme cases when special persuasion was needed.  "Mais, mon cher, I did th
is for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience, and there is nothing to thank me fo
r. No one has ever complained yet of being too much loved and besides, you are fr
ee, you could throw it up tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself when
 you get to Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these terrible r
ecollections." Prince Vasili sighed. "Yes, yes, my boy. And my valet can go in yo
ur carriage. Ah! I was nearly forgetting," he added. "You know, mon cher, your fa
ther and I had some accounts to settle, so I have received what was due from the 
Ryazan estate and will keep it you won't require it. We'll go into the accounts l
ater."  By "what was due from the Ryazan estate" Prince Vasili meant several thou
sand rubles quitrent received from Pierre's peasants, which the prince had retain
ed for himself.  In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of
 gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the rank for h
e did nothing, that Prince Vasili had procured for him, and acquaintances, invita
tions, and social occupations were so numerous that, even more than in Moscow, he
 felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle, and continual expectation of some good, al
ways in front of him but never attained.  Of his former bachelor acquaintances ma
ny were no longer in Petersburg. The Guards had gone to the front Dolokhov had be
en reduced to the ranks Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces Prince
 Andrew was abroad so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he us
ed to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend old
er than himself and whom he respected. His whole time was taken up with dinners a
nd balls and was spent chiefly at Prince Vasili's house in the company of the sto
ut princess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter Helene.  Like the others, Anna 
Pavlovna Scherer showed Pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken p
lace in society.  Formerly in Anna Pavlovna's presence, Pierre had always felt th
at what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that remarks whi
ch seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as h
e uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyte's stupidest remarks came out clev
er and apt. Now everything Pierre said was charmant. Even if Anna Pavlovna did no
t say so, he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for hi
s modesty.  In the beginning of the winter of 18056 Pierre received one of Anna P
avlovna's usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added "You will find t
he beautiful Helene here, whom it is always delightful to see."  When he read tha
t sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people reco
gnized had grown up between himself and Helene, and that thought both alarmed him
, as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and
 pleased him as an entertaining supposition.  Anna Pavlovna's "At Home" was like 
the former one, only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortema
rt, but a diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the Emper
or Alexander's visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august friends had pledged th
emselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the e
nemy of the human race. Anna Pavlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy,
 evidently relating to the young man's recent loss by the death of Count Bezukhov
 everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly af
flicted by the death of the father he had hardly known, and her melancholy was ju
st like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august Majest
y the Empress Marya Fedorovna. Pierre felt flattered by this. Anna Pavlovna arran
ged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual skill. The large g
roup, in which were Prince Vasili and the generals, had the benefit of the diplom
at. Another group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former, but Ann
a Pavlovnawho was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to who
m thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in
 actionseeing Pierre, touched his sleeve with her finger, saying  "Wait a bit, I 
have something in view for you this evening." She glanced at Helene and smiled at
 her. "My dear Helene, be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep 
her company for ten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear c
ount who will not refuse to accompany you."  The beauty went to the aunt, but Ann
a Pavlovna detained Pierre, looking as if she had to give some final necessary in
structions.  "Isn't she exquisite?" she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately b
eauty as she glided away. "And how she carries herself! For so young a girl, such
 tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from her heart. Happy the man
 who wins her! With her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant po
sition in society. Don't you think so? I only wanted to know your opinion," and A
nna Pavlovna let Pierre go.  Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to He
lene's perfection of manner. If he ever thought of Helene, it was just of her bea
uty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society.  The old
 aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed desirous of hiding 
her adoration for Helene and inclined rather to show her fear of Anna Pavlovna. S
he looked at her niece, as if inquiring what she was to do with these people. On 
leaving them, Anna Pavlovna again touched Pierre's sleeve, saying "I hope you won
't say that it is dull in my house again," and she glanced at Helene.  Helene smi
led, with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing
 her without being enchanted. The aunt coughed, swallowed, and said in French tha
t she was very pleased to see Helene, then she turned to Pierre with the same wor
ds of welcome and the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation
, Helene turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyo
ne. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little meaning for him, that 
he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffbo
xes that had belonged to Pierre's father, Count Bezukhov, and showed them her own
 box. Princess Helene asked to see the portrait of the aunt's husband on the box 
lid.  "That is probably the work of Vinesse," said Pierre, mentioning a celebrate
d miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to 
hear what was being said at the other table.  He half rose, meaning to go round, 
but the aunt handed him the snuffbox, passing it across Helene's back. Helene sto
oped forward to make room, and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at e
vening parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at fro
nt and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre, was so clos
e to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of he
r neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a 
little to have touched them. He was conscious of the warmth of her body, the scen
t of perfume, and the creaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see her mar
ble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body
 only covered by her garments. And having once seen this he could not help being 
aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through.  "So 
you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?" Helene seemed to say. "You had
 not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who may belong to anyoneto you 
too," said her glance. And at that moment Pierre felt that Helene not only could,
 but must, be his wife, and that it could not be otherwise.  He knew this at that
 moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her. How and when 
this would be he did not know, he did not even know if it would be a good thing h
e even felt, he knew not why, that it would be a bad thing, but he knew it would 
happen.  Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see 
her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every day until 
then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more than a man who has bee
n looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can
 again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass. 
She was terribly close to him. She already had power over him, and between them t
here was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will.  "Well, I will
 leave you in your little corner," came Anna Pavlovna's voice, "I see you are all
 right there."  And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anyt
hing reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone kne
w what had happened to him as he knew it himself.  A little later when he went up
 to the large circle, Anna Pavlovna said to him "I hear you are refitting your Pe
tersburg house?"  This was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary
, and Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house done 
up.  "That's a good thing, but don't move from Prince Vasili's. It is good to hav
e a friend like the prince," she said, smiling at Prince Vasili. "I know somethin
g about that. Don't I? And you are still so young. You need advice. Don't be angr
y with me for exercising an old woman's privilege."  She paused, as women always 
do, expecting something after they have mentioned their age. "If you marry it wil
l be a different thing," she continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre d
id not look at Helene nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. 
He muttered something and colored.  When he got home he could not sleep for a lon
g time for thinking of what had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had mere
ly understood that the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was
 mentioned he had said absentmindedly "Yes, she's good looking," he had understoo
d that this woman might belong to him.  "But she's stupid. I have myself said she
 is stupid," he thought. "There is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeli
ng she excites in me. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with 
her and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that's why he was s
ent away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince Vasili is her father... It's bad....
" he reflected, but while he was thinking this the reflection was still incomplet
e, he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had s
prung up, and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she
 would be his wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all he
 had thought and heard of her might be false. And he again saw her not as the dau
ghter of Prince Vasili, but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dre
ss. "But no! Why did this thought never occur to me before?" and again he told hi
mself that it was impossible, that there would be something unnatural, and as it 
seemed to him dishonorable, in this marriage. He recalled her former words and lo
oks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together. He recalled Anna
 Pavlovna's words and looks when she spoke to him about his house, recalled thous
ands of such hints from Prince Vasili and others, and was seized by terror lest h
e had already, in some way, bound himself to do something that was evidently wron
g and that he ought not to do. But at the very time he was expressing this convic
tion to himself, in another part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly be
auty.      CHAPTER II   In November, 1805, Prince Vasili had to go on a tour of i
nspection in four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to 
visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole where hi
s regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas Bolkonski in orde
r to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man. But before l
eaving home and undertaking these new affairs, Prince Vasili had to settle matter
s with Pierre, who, it is true, had latterly spent whole days at home, that is, i
n Prince Vasili's house where he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and f
oolish in Helene's presence as a lover should be, but had not yet proposed to her
.  "This is all very fine, but things must be settled," said Prince Vasili to him
self, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that Pierre who was under such 
obligations to him "But never mind that" was not behaving very well in this matte
r. "Youth, frivolity... well, God be with him," thought he, relishing his own goo
dness of heart, "but it must be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be
 Lelya's name day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does not understa
nd what he ought to do then it will be my affairyes, my affair. I am her father."
  Six weeks after Anna Pavlovna's "At Home" and after the sleepless night when he
 had decided that to marry Helene would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid 
her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision, had not left Prince Vasili's and 
felt with terror that in people's eyes he was every day more and more connected w
ith her, that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her
, that he could not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible t
hing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have been able t
o free himself but that Prince Vasili who had rarely before given receptions now 
hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which Pierre had to be 
present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone's 
expectation. Prince Vasili, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take P
ierre's hand in passing and draw it downwards, or absentmindedly hold out his wri
nkled, cleanshaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say "Till tomorrow," or, "B
e in to dinner or I shall not see you," or, "I am staying in for your sake," and 
so on. And though Prince Vasili, when he stayed in as he said for Pierre's sake, 
hardly exchanged a couple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him
. Every day he said to himself one and the same thing "It is time I understood he
r and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken
 now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent girl," he sometimes said to hims
elf "she never makes a mistake, never says anything stupid. She says little, but 
what she does say is always clear and simple, so she is not stupid. She never was
 abashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman!" He had often begu
n to make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had always answered 
him either by a brief but appropriate remarkshowing that it did not interest hero
r by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed Pierre
 her superiority. She was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in compari
son with that smile.  She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile m
eant for him alone, in which there was something more significant than in the gen
eral smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was waitin
g for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that sooner or late
r he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thoug
ht of that dreadful step. A thousand times during that month and a half while he 
felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himse
lf "What am I doing? I need resolution. Can it be that I have none?"  He wished t
o take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that streng
th of will which he had known in himself and really possessed. Pierre was one of 
those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent, and since tha
t day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuf
fbox at Anna Pavlovna's, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire para
lyzed his will.  On Helene's name day, a small party of just their own peopleas h
is wife saidmet for supper at Prince Vasili's. All these friends and relations ha
d been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that 
evening. The visitors were seated at supper. Princess Kuragina, a portly imposing
 woman who had once been handsome, was sitting at the head of the table. On eithe
r side of her sat the more important guestsan old general and his wife, and Anna 
Pavlovna Scherer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests, and
 there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and Helene, side by side. Pr
ince Vasili was not having any supper he went round the table in a merry mood, si
tting down now by one, now by another, of the guests. To each of them he made som
e careless and agreeable remark except to Pierre and Helene, whose presence he se
emed not to notice. He enlivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly
, the silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies' toilets and the gold and sil
ver of the men's epaulets servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table, the
 clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several 
conversations. At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was heard assuring an
 old baroness that he loved her passionately, at which she laughed at the other c
ould be heard the story of the misfortunes of some Mary Viktorovna or other. At t
he center of the table, Prince Vasili attracted everybody's attention. With a fac
etious smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday's meetin
g of the Imperial Council, at which Sergey Kuzmich Vyazmitinov, the new military 
governor general of Petersburg, had received and read the then famous rescript of
 the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergey Kuzmich, in which the Emperor said
 that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the people's loyalty, that 
the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that he was pro
ud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it. This
 rescript began with the words "Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides reports reach me,"
 etc.  "Well, and so he never got farther than 'Sergey Kuzmich'?" asked one of th
e ladies.  "Exactly, not a hair's breadth farther," answered Prince Vasili, laugh
ing, "'Sergey Kuzmich... From all sides... From all sides... Sergey Kuzmich...' P
oor Vyazmitinov could not get any farther! He began the rescript again and again,
 but as soon as he uttered 'Sergey' he sobbed, 'Kuzmich,' tears, and 'From all si
des' was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. And again his handkerchie
f, and again 'Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides,'... and tears, till at last somebod
y else was asked to read it."  "Kuzmich... From all sides... and then tears," som
eone repeated laughing.  "Don't be unkind," cried Anna Pavlovna from her end of t
he table holding up a threatening finger. "He is such a worthy and excellent man,
 our dear Vyazmitinov...."  Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the ta
ble, where the honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and unde
r the influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and Helene sat s
ilently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a suppressed smile bright
ening both their faces, a smile that had nothing to do with Sergey Kuzmicha smile
 of bashfulness at their own feelings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, 
and joked, much as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, saute, and ices, and however th
ey avoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as they seem
ed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story abo
ut Sergey Kuzmich, the laughter, and the food were all a pretense, and that the w
hole attention of that company was directed toPierre and Helene. Prince Vasili mi
micked the sobbing of Sergey Kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward
 his daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said "Yes.
.. it's getting on, it will all be settled today." Anna Pavlovna threatened him o
n behalf of "our dear Vyazmitinov," and in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanc
ed at Pierre, Prince Vasili read a congratulation on his future soninlaw and on h
is daughter's happiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine t
o the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh seem
ed to say "Yes, there's nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine, my dea
r, now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly, provocative
ly happy." "And what nonsense all this is that I am saying!" thought a diplomatis
t, glancing at the happy faces of the lovers. "That's happiness!"  Into the insig
nificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the
 simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman f
or one another. And this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above
 all their affected chatter. Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the a
nimation was evidently forced. Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting a
t table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked at the b
eautiful Helene with her radiant face and at the red, broad, and happy though une
asy face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on 
those two happy faces alone.  Pierre felt that he was the center of it all, and t
his both pleased and embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some
 occupation. He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and t
hen detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly th
rough his mind.  "So it is all finished!" he thought. "And how has it all happene
d? How quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself alone, bu
t because of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They are all expecting it, 
they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I cannot, disappoint them. Bu
t how will it be? I do not know, but it will certainly happen!" thought Pierre, g
lancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes.  Or he would suddenly feel
 ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it awkward to attract everyone's attention 
and to be considered a lucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a s
ort of Paris possessed of a Helen. "But no doubt it always is and must be so!" he
 consoled himself. "And besides, what have I done to bring it about? How did it b
egin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vasili. Then there was nothing. So why s
hould I not stay at his house? Then I played cards with her and picked up her ret
icule and drove out with her. How did it begin, when did it all come about?" And 
here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her ne
arness, her breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would suddenly seem to 
him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was why 
they all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration he would expa
nd his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good fortune. Suddenly he heard 
a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time. But Pierre was so abso
rbed that he did not understand what was said.  "I am asking you when you last he
ard from Bolkonski," repeated Prince Vasili a third time. "How absentminded you a
re, my dear fellow."  Prince Vasili smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was 
smiling at him and Helene. "Well, what of it, if you all know it?" thought Pierre
. "What of it? It's the truth!" and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile,
 and Helene smiled too.  "When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmutz?" repea
ted Prince Vasili, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a disput
e.  "How can one talk or think of such trifles?" thought Pierre.  "Yes, from Olmu
tz," he answered, with a sigh.  After supper Pierre with his partner followed the
 others into the drawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking 
leave of Helene. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupati
on, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away, refusing to let her se
e them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing r
oom. He pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre's 
happiness. The old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. "
Oh, the old fool," he thought. "That Princess Helene will be beautiful still when
 she's fifty."  "I think I may congratulate you," whispered Anna Pavlovna to the 
old princess, kissing her soundly. "If I hadn't this headache I'd have stayed lon
ger."  The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her daugh
ter's happiness.  While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a 
long time alone with Helene in the little drawing room where they were sitting. H
e had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her, but had n
ever spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable, but he could not 
make up his mind to take the final step. He felt ashamed he felt that he was occu
pying someone else's place here beside Helene. "This happiness is not for you," s
ome inner voice whispered to him. "This happiness is for those who have not in th
em what there is in you."  But, as he had to say something, he began by asking he
r whether she was satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manne
r that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.  S
ome of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in the large dra
wing room. Prince Vasili came up to Pierre with languid footsteps. Pierre rose an
d said it was getting late. Prince Vasili gave him a look of stern inquiry, as th
ough what Pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in. But 
then the expression of severity changed, and he drew Pierre's hand downwards, mad
e him sit down, and smiled affectionately.  "Well, Lelya?" he asked, turning inst
antly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tende
rness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which 
Prince Vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents.  And he again turned 
to Pierre.  "Sergey KuzmichFrom all sides" he said, unbuttoning the top button of
 his waistcoat.  Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the 
story about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince Vasili just then, and Prince Va
sili saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered something and went away. It 
seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted. The sight of the discompo
sure of that old man of the world touched Pierre he looked at Helene and she too 
seemed disconcerted, and her look seemed to say "Well, it is your own fault."  "T
he step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!" thought Pierre, and he again began
 speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergey Kuzmich, asking what the point 
of the story was as he had not heard it properly. Helene answered with a smile th
at she too had missed it.  When Prince Vasili returned to the drawing room, the p
rincess, his wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.  "O
f course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear..."  "Marriages ar
e made in heaven," replied the elderly lady.  Prince Vasili passed by, seeming no
t to hear the ladies, and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He clos
ed his eyes and seemed to be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused him
self.  "Aline," he said to his wife, "go and see what they are about."  The princ
ess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air, and g
lanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and Helene still sat talking just as 
before.  "Still the same," she said to her husband.  Prince Vasili frowned, twist
ing his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse, unpleasant ex
pression peculiar to him. Shaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with
 resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick ste
ps he went joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierr
e rose in alarm on seeing it.  "Thank God!" said Prince Vasili. "My wife has told
 me everything!" He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter."
My dear boy... Lelya... I am very pleased." His voice trembled. "I loved your fat
her... and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!..."  He embraced his d
aughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his malodorous mouth. Tears a
ctually moistened his cheeks.  "Princess, come here!" he shouted.  The old prince
ss came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using her handkerchief too. Pierre
 was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful Helene's hand several times. After a whi
le they were left alone again.  "All this had to be and could not be otherwise," 
thought Pierre, "so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good be
cause it's definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt." Pierre held the 
hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and f
ell.  "Helene!" he said aloud and paused.  "Something special is always said in s
uch cases," he thought, but could not remember what it was that people say. He lo
oked at her face. She drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.  "Oh, take those off.
.. those..." she said, pointing to his spectacles.  Pierre took them off, and his
 eyes, besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been re
moved, had also a frightened and inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her h
and and kiss it, but with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she interc
epted his lips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,
 unpleasantly excited expression.  "It is too late now, it's done besides I love 
her," thought Pierre.  "Je vous aime!" * he said, remembering what has to be said
 at such moments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.  
     * "I love you."   Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezuk
hov's large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people sai
d, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money.      CHAPTER I
II   Old Prince Nicholas Bolkonski received a letter from Prince Vasili in Novemb
er, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him a visit. "I am start
ing on a journey of inspection, and of course I shall think nothing of an extra s
eventy miles to come and see you at the same time, my honored benefactor," wrote 
Prince Vasili. "My son Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I ho
pe you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his 
father, he feels for you."  "It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary ou
t, suitors are coming to us of their own accord," incautiously remarked the littl
e princess on hearing the news.  Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.  A fo
rtnight after the letter Prince Vasili's servants came one evening in advance of 
him, and he and his son arrived next day.  Old Bolkonski had always had a poor op
inion of Prince Vasili's character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns
 of Paul and Alexander Prince Vasili had risen to high position and honors. And n
ow, from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess, he s
aw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into a feeling of 
contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned him. On the day of Prince
 Vasili's arrival, Prince Bolkonski was particularly discontented and out of temp
er. Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasili was coming, or whether h
is being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vasili's visit, he 
was in a bad temper, and in the morning Tikhon had already advised the architect 
not to go to the prince with his report.  "Do you hear how he's walking?" said Ti
khon, drawing the architect's attention to the sound of the prince's footsteps. "
Stepping flat on his heelswe know what that means...."  However, at nine o'clock 
the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap, went out for his usua
l walk. It had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse, along which th
e prince was in the habit of walking, had been swept the marks of the broom were 
still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft 
snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince went through the conse
rvatories, the serfs' quarters, and the outbuildings, frowning and silent.  "Can 
a sleigh pass?" he asked his overseer, a venerable man, resembling his master in 
manners and looks, who was accompanying him back to the house.  "The snow is deep
. I am having the avenue swept, your honor."  The prince bowed his head and went 
up to the porch. "God be thanked," thought the overseer, "the storm has blown ove
r!"  "It would have been hard to drive up, your honor," he added. "I heard, your 
honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor."  The prince turned round t
o the overseer and fixed his eyes on him, frowning.  "What? A minister? What mini
ster? Who gave orders?" he said in his shrill, harsh voice. "The road is not swep
t for the princess my daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no minister
s!"  "Your honor, I thought..."  "You thought!" shouted the prince, his words com
ing more and more rapidly and indistinctly. "You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards
!... I'll teach you to think!" and lifting his stick he swung it and would have h
it Alpatych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow. "Th
ought... Blackguards..." shouted the prince rapidly.  But although Alpatych, frig
htened at his own temerity in avoiding the stroke, came up to the prince, bowing 
his bald head resignedly before him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince,
 though he continued to shout "Blackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!" 
did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house.  Before dinner, Princess
 Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew that the prince was in a bad humor, st
ood awaiting him Mademoiselle Bourienne with a radiant face that said "I know not
hing, I am the same as usual," and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downc
ast eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she o
ught to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not. She thought "If I seem
 not to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him if I seem sad and 
out of spirits myself, he will say as he has done before that I'm in the dumps." 
 The prince looked at his daughter's frightened face and snorted.  "Fool... or du
mmy!" he muttered.  "And the other one is not here. They've been telling tales," 
he thoughtreferring to the little princess who was not in the dining room.  "Wher
e is the princess?" he asked. "Hiding?"  "She is not very well," answered Mademoi
selle Bourienne with a bright smile, "so she won't come down. It is natural in he
r state."  "Hm! Hm!" muttered the prince, sitting down.  His plate seemed to him 
not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he flung it away. Tikhon caught it and ha
nded it to a footman. The little princess was not unwell, but had such an overpow
ering fear of the prince that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not
 to appear.  "I am afraid for the baby," she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne "Heav
en knows what a fright might do."  In general at Bald Hills the little princess l
ived in constant fear, and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she 
did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince rec
iprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt for her. When th
e little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald Hills, she took a special 
fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole days with her, asked her to sleep in
 her room, and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him.  "S
o we are to have visitors, mon prince?" remarked Mademoiselle Bourienne, unfoldin
g her white napkin with her rosy fingers. "His Excellency Prince Vasili Kuragin a
nd his son, I understand?" she said inquiringly.  "Hm!his excellency is a puppy..
.. I got him his appointment in the service," said the prince disdainfully. "Why 
his son is coming I don't understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mar
y know. I don't want him." He looked at his blushing daughter. "Are you unwell to
day? Eh? Afraid of the 'minister' as that idiot Alpatych called him this morning?
"  "No, mon pere."  Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her
 choice of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the conservat
ories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and after the soup the pri
nce became more genial.  After dinner, he went to see his daughterinlaw. The litt
le princess was sitting at a small table, chattering with Masha, her maid. She gr
ew pale on seeing her fatherinlaw.  She was much altered. She was now plain rathe
r than pretty. Her cheeks had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down
.  "Yes, I feel a kind of oppression," she said in reply to the prince's question
 as to how she felt.  "Do you want anything?"  "No, merci, mon pere."  "Well, all
 right, all right."  He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych
 stood with bowed head.  "Has the snow been shoveled back?"  "Yes, your excellenc
y. Forgive me for heaven's sake... It was only my stupidity."  "All right, all ri
ght," interrupted the prince, and laughing his unnatural way, he stretched out hi
s hand for Alpatych to kiss, and then proceeded to his study.  Prince Vasili arri
ved that evening. He was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen, who, with lou
d shouts, dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely lad
en with snow.  Prince Vasili and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.  An
atole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a table on a co
rner of which he smilingly and absentmindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes. 
He regarded his whole life as a continual round of amusement which someone for so
me reason had to provide for him. And he looked on this visit to a churlish old m
an and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought, turn 
out very well and amusingly. "And why not marry her if she really has so much mon
ey? That never does any harm," thought Anatole.  He shaved and scented himself wi
th the care and elegance which had become habitual to him and, his handsome head 
held high, entered his father's room with the goodhumored and victorious air natu
ral to him. Prince Vasili's two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked roun
d with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered, as 
if to say "Yes, that's how I want you to look."  "I say, Father, joking apart, is
 she very hideous?" Anatole asked, as if continuing a conversation the subject of
 which had often been mentioned during the journey.  "Enough! What nonsense! Abov
e all, try to be respectful and cautious with the old prince."  "If he starts a r
ow I'll go away," said Prince Anatole. "I can't bear those old men! Eh?"  "Rememb
er, for you everything depends on this."  In the meantime, not only was it known 
in the maidservants' rooms that the minister and his son had arrived, but the app
earance of both had been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in h
er room, vainly trying to master her agitation.  "Why did they write, why did Lis
e tell me about it? It can never happen!" she said, looking at herself in the gla
ss. "How shall I enter the drawing room? Even if I like him I can't now be myself
 with him." The mere thought of her father's look filled her with terror. The lit
tle princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received from Masha, the lady
's maid, the necessary report of how handsome the minister's son was, with his ro
sy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty the father had dragged his 
legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time
. Having received this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienn
e, whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess 
Mary's room.  "You know they've come, Marie?" said the little princess, waddling 
in, and sinking heavily into an armchair.  She was no longer in the loose gown sh
e generally wore in the morning, but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was
 carefully done and her face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its su
nken and faded outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was 
still more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch had
 been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne's toilet which rendered her fresh and prett
y face yet more attractive.  "What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear prin
cess?" she began. "They'll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing ro
om and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!" 
 The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily began t
o devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be dressed. Princess Ma
ry's selfesteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her
, and still more so by both her companions' not having the least conception that 
it could be otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for the
m would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to dress her wo
uld prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes grew dim
, red blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expre
ssion it so often wore, as she submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Li
se. Both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so pl
ain that neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing he
r with perfect sincerity, and with the naive and firm conviction women have that 
dress can make a face pretty.  "No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty," sa
id Lise, looking sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. "You have a ma
roon dress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may be 
at stake. But this one is too light, it's not becoming!"  It was not the dress, b
ut the face and whole figure of Princess Mary that was not pretty, but neither Ma
demoiselle Bourienne nor the little princess felt this they still thought that if
 a blue ribbon were placed in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf ar
ranged lower on the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot 
that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that however th
ey might change the setting and adornment of that face, it would still remain pit
eous and plain. After two or three changes to which Princess Mary meekly submitte
d, just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head a style that quite a
ltered and spoiled her looks and she had put on a maroon dress with a paleblue sc
arf, the little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the dres
s with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head 
bent first on one side and then on the other.  "No, it will not do," she said dec
idedly, clasping her hands. "No, Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I pre
fer you in your little gray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,
" she said to the maid, "bring the princess her gray dress, and you'll see, Madem
oiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it," she added, smiling with a foretaste o
f artistic pleasure.  But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary re
mained sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the m
irror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst into sobs.  
"Come, dear princess," said Mademoiselle Bourienne, "just one more little effort.
"  The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess Mary.
  "Well, now we'll arrange something quite simple and becoming," she said.  The t
hree voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne's, and Katie's, who was laughing at som
ething, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping of birds.  "No, leave me alon
e," said Princess Mary.  Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirpin
g of the birds was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thought
ful eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at them,
 and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.  "At least, change 
your coiffure," said the little princess. "Didn't I tell you," she went on, turni
ng reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne, "Mary's is a face which such a coiffu
re does not suit in the least. Not in the least! Please change it."  "Leave me al
one, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to me," answered a voice str
uggling with tears.  Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to
 themselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual,
 but it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they both knew, 
an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess Mary did not fright
en them she never inspired fear in anyone, but they knew that when it appeared on
 her face, she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination.  "You w
ill change it, won't you?" said Lise. And as Princess Mary gave no answer, she le
ft the room.  Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise's reques
t, she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her glass. Lett
ing her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and pondered. A husband,
 a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination,
 and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own. She fancied a c
hild, her ownsuch as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurse's daugh
terat her own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the 
child. "But no, it is impossible, I am too ugly," she thought.  "Please come to t
ea. The prince will be out in a moment," came the maid's voice at the door.  She 
roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and before going
 down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her eyes fixed on the dark
 face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a lamp, she stood before it with fold
ed hands for a few moments. A painful doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of lov
e, of earthly love for a man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Ma
ry dreamed of happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden lo
nging was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from others a
nd even from herself, the stronger it grew. "O God," she said, "how am I to stifl
e in my heart these temptations of the devil? How am I to renounce forever these 
vile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?" And scarcely had she put tha
t question than God gave her the answer in her own heart. "Desire nothing for thy
self, seek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Man's future and thy own fate must
 remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If 
it be God's will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill His
 will." With this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of he
r forbidden earthly longing Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went
 down, thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor o
f what she would say. What could all that matter in comparison with the will of G
od, without Whose care not a hair of man's head can fall?      CHAPTER IV   When 
Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasili and his son were already in the drawing ro
om, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne. When she entered w
ith her heavy step, treading on her heels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourien
ne rose and the little princess, indicating her to the gentlemen, said "Voila Mar
ie!" Princess Mary saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vasili's f
ace, serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, a
nd the little princess curiously noting the impression "Marie" produced on the vi
sitors. And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and 
her unusually animated look which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, sh
e only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as she ente
red the room. Prince Vasili approached first, and she kissed the bold forehead th
at bent over her hand and answered his question by saying that, on the contrary, 
she remembered him quite well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still could not s
ee him. She only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her li
ps a white forehead, over which was beautiful lightbrown hair smelling of pomade.
 When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood with his r
ight thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn i
n, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with beam
ing face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at
 all. Anatole was not quickwitted, nor ready or eloquent in conversation, but he 
had the faculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable selfpos
session. If a man lacking in selfconfidence remains dumb on a first introduction 
and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to 
find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, a
nd smilingly examined the princess' hair. It was evident that he could be silent 
in this way for a very long time. "If anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let
 him talk, but I don't want to," he seemed to say. Besides this, in his behavior 
to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe,
 and even lovea supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as if h
e said to them "I know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you? You'd 
be only too glad, of course." Perhaps he did not really think this when he met wo
meneven probably he did not, for in general he thought very littlebut his looks a
nd manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as if wishing to show
 him that she did not even dare expect to interest him, she turned to his father.
 The conversation was general and animated, thanks to Princess Lise's voice and l
ittle downy lip that lifted over her white teeth. She met Prince Vasili with that
 playful manner often employed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the ass
umption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some sem
iprivate, longestablished jokes and amusing reminiscences, though no such reminis
cences really existjust as none existed in this case. Prince Vasili readily adopt
ed her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into
 these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bour
ienne also shared them and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to sha
re in these merry reminiscences.  "Here at least we shall have the benefit of you
r company all to ourselves, dear prince," said the little princess of course, in 
French to Prince Vasili. "It's not as at Annette's * receptions where you always 
ran away you remember cette chere Annette!"       * Anna Pavlovna.   "Ah, but you
 won't talk politics to me like Annette!"  "And our little tea table?"  "Oh, yes!
"  "Why is it you were never at Annette's?" the little princess asked Anatole. "A
h, I know, I know," she said with a sly glance, "your brother Hippolyte told me a
bout your goings on. Oh!" and she shook her finger at him, "I have even heard of 
your doings in Paris!"  "And didn't Hippolyte tell you?" asked Prince Vasili, tur
ning to his son and seizing the little princess' arm as if she would have run awa
y and he had just managed to catch her, "didn't he tell you how he himself was pi
ning for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? Oh, she is a pearl a
mong women, Princess," he added, turning to Princess Mary.  When Paris was mentio
ned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the
 general current of recollections.  She took the liberty of inquiring whether it 
was long since Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole ans
wered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to he
r about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole came to
 the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either. "Not at all bad!" 
he thought, examining her, "not at all bad, that little companion! I hope she wil
l bring her along with her when we're married, la petite est gentille." *       *
 The little one is charming.   The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, fro
wning and considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him
. "What are Prince Vasili and that son of his to me? Prince Vasili is a shallow b
raggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen," he grumbled to himself. What 
angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettle
d question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself.
 The question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter a
nd give her to a husband. The prince never directly asked himself that question, 
knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed no
t only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without Prin
cess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. "And why sho
uld she marry?" he thought. "To be unhappy for certain. There's Lise, married to 
Andrewa better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadaysbut is she c
ontented with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! The
y'll take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried
, and even the happier for it?" So thought Prince Bolkonski while dressing, and y
et the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer. Prince Va
sili had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing, and today or to
morrow he would probably ask for an answer. His birth and position in society wer
e not bad. "Well, I've nothing against it," the prince said to himself, "but he m
ust be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see."  "That is what we shall see
! That is what we shall see!" he added aloud.  He entered the drawing room with h
is usual alert step, glancing rapidly round the company. He noticed the change in
 the little princess' dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne's ribbon, Princess Mary's unb
ecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne's and Anatole's smiles, and the loneline
ss of his daughter amid the general conversation. "Got herself up like a fool!" h
e thought, looking irritably at her. "She is shameless, and he ignores her!"  He 
went straight up to Prince Vasili.  "Well! How d'ye do? How d'ye do? Glad to see 
you!"  "Friendship laughs at distance," began Prince Vasili in his usual rapid, s
elfconfident, familiar tone. "Here is my second son please love and befriend him.
"  Prince Bolkonski surveyed Anatole.  "Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!" he
 said. "Well, come and kiss me," and he offered his cheek.  Anatole kissed the ol
d man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure, waiting for a disp
lay of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect.  Prince Bolkonski sa
t down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and, drawing up an armchair f
or Prince Vasili, pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs
 and news. He seemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vasili said, but kept g
lancing at Princess Mary.  "And so they are writing from Potsdam already?" he sai
d, repeating Prince Vasili's last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his 
daughter.  "Is it for visitors you've got yourself up like that, eh?" said he. "F
ine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors, and 
before the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change you
r way of dress without my consent."  "It was my fault, mon pere," interceded the 
little princess, with a blush.  "You must do as you please," said Prince Bolkonsk
i, bowing to his daughterinlaw, "but she need not make a fool of herself, she's p
lain enough as it is."  And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his da
ughter, who was reduced to tears.  "On the contrary, that coiffure suits the prin
cess very well," said Prince Vasili.  "Now you, young prince, what's your name?" 
said Prince Bolkonski, turning to Anatole, "come here, let us talk and get acquai
nted."  "Now the fun begins," thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside t
he old prince.  "Well, my dear boy, I hear you've been educated abroad, not taugh
t to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear 
boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?" asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatol
e closely and intently.  "No, I have been transferred to the line," said Anatole,
 hardly able to restrain his laughter.  "Ah! That's a good thing. So, my dear boy
, you wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow m
ust serve. Well, are you off to the front?"  "No, Prince, our regiment has gone t
o the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?" said Anatol
e, turning to his father with a laugh.  "A splendid soldier, splendid! 'What am I
 attached to!' Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Prince Bolkonski, and Anatole laughed still l
ouder. Suddenly Prince Bolkonski frowned.  "You may go," he said to Anatole.  Ana
tole returned smiling to the ladies.  "And so you've had him educated abroad, Pri
nce Vasili, haven't you?" said the old prince to Prince Vasili.  "I have done my 
best for him, and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours."
  "Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad's a fine
 fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now." He took Prince Vasili's arm and 
led him to his study. As soon as they were alone together, Prince Vasili announce
d his hopes and wishes to the old prince.  "Well, do you think I shall prevent he
r, that I can't part from her?" said the old prince angrily. "What an idea! I'm r
eady for it tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my soninlaw better. Yo
u know my principleseverything aboveboard? I will ask her tomorrow in your presen
ce if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and I'll see." The old pri
nce snorted. "Let her marry, it's all the same to me!" he screamed in the same pi
ercing tone as when parting from his son.  "I will tell you frankly," said Prince
 Vasili in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning wi
th so keensighted companion. "You know, you see right through people. Anatole is 
no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad an excellent son or kinsman."  "A
ll right, all right, we'll see!"  As always happens when women lead lonely lives 
for any length of time without male society, on Anatole's appearance all the thre
e women of Prince Bolkonski's household felt that their life had not been real ti
ll then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately increased 
tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in darkness, was sudden
ly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.  Princess Mary grew quite un
conscious of her face and coiffure. The handsome open face of the man who might p
erhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, d
etermined, manly, and magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dream
s of a future family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them awa
y and tried to conceal them.  "But am I not too cold with him?" thought the princ
ess. "I try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him
 already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do n
ot like him."  And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to he
r new guest. "Poor girl, she's devilish ugly!" thought Anatole.  Mademoiselle Bou
rienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole's arrival, thought in another 
way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman without any definite position, withou
t relations or even a country, did not intend to devote her life to serving Princ
e Bolkonski, to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademo
iselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to apprecia
te at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian prin
cesses, would fall in love with her and carry her off and here at last was a Russ
ian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but finished
 in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl
 who had been seduced, and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mere appeared, and r
eproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle Bourienne
 was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him, her sed
ucer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had appeared. He would carry her away an
d then sa pauvre mere would appear and he would marry her. So her future shaped i
tself in Mademoiselle Bourienne's head at the very time she was talking to Anatol
e about Paris. It was not calculation that guided her she did not even for a mome
nt consider what she should do, but all this had long been familiar to her, and n
ow that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and
 tried to please him as much as possible.  The little princess, like an old war h
orse that hears the trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, pr
epared for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any st
ruggle, but with naive and lighthearted gaiety.  Although in female society Anato
le usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women, his vanit
y was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides tha
t, he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne
 that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness
 and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.  After tea, the compan
y went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was asked to play on the clavichor
d. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing h
er and beside Mademoiselle Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfull
y joyous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic worl
d and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But Anatole's
 expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to the mo
vements of Mademoiselle Bourienne's little foot, which he was then touching with 
his own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess
 Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was a
lso new to the princess.  "How she loves me!" thought Princess Mary. "How happy I
 am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband? C
an it be possible?" she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feelin
g his eyes gazing at her.  In the evening, after supper, when all were about to r
etire, Anatole kissed Princess Mary's hand. She did not know how she found the co
urage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shor
tsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle Bour
ienne's hand. This was not etiquette, but then he did everything so simply and wi
th such assurance! Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a fright
ened look.  "What delicacy!" thought the princess. "Is it possible that Amelie" M
ademoiselle Bourienne "thinks I could be jealous of her, and not value her pure a
ffection and devotion to me?" She went up to her and kissed her warmly. Anatole w
ent up to kiss the little princess' hand.  "No! No! No! When your father writes t
o tell me that you are behaving well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till th
en!" she said. And smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.      CHA
PTER V   They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he go
t into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.  "Is he really to be my husban
d, this stranger who is so kindyes, kind, that is the chief thing," thought Princ
ess Mary and fear, which she had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to
 look round, it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen i
n the dark corner. And this someone was hethe deviland he was also this man with 
the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.  She rang for her maid and aske
d her to sleep in her room.  Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conser
vatory for a long time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at som
eone, now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mere
 rebuking her for her fall.  The little princess grumbled to her maid that her be
d was badly made. She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every posi
tion was awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than ev
er because Anatole's presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was n
ot like that and when everything was light and gay. She sat in an armchair in her
 dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and turned t
he heavy feather bed for the third time, muttering to herself.  "I told you it wa
s all lumps and holes!" the little princess repeated. "I should be glad enough to
 fall asleep, so it's not my fault!" and her voice quivered like that of a child 
about to cry.  The old prince did not sleep either. Tikhon, half asleep, heard hi
m pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he had been in
sulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed because it concerned
 not himself but another, his daughter, whom he loved more than himself. He kept 
telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right
 and how he should act, but instead of that he only excited himself more and more
.  "The first man that turns upshe forgets her father and everything else, runs u
pstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself! Glad to thr
ow her father over! And she knew I should notice it. Fr... fr... fr! And don't I 
see that that idiot had eyes only for BourienneI shall have to get rid of her. An
d how is it she has not pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself s
he might at least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thi
nks nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but I'll 
let her see...."  The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making
 a mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess 
Mary's selfesteem would be wounded and his point not to be parted from her would 
be gained, so pacifying himself with this thought, he called Tikhon and began to 
undress.  "What devil brought them here?" thought he, while Tikhon was putting th
e nightshirt over his driedup old body and grayhaired chest. "I never invited the
m. They came to disturb my lifeand there is not much of it left."  "Devil take 'e
m!" he muttered, while his head was still covered by the shirt.  Tikhon knew his 
master's habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and therefore met with unaltered look
s the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt.  "G
one to bed?" asked the prince.  Tikhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew 
the direction of his master's thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to 
Prince Vasili and his son.  "They have gone to bed and put out their lights, your
 excellency."  "No good... no good..." said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his
 feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, he we
nt to the couch on which he slept.  Though no words had passed between Anatole an
d Mademoiselle Bourienne, they quite understood one another as to the first part 
of their romance, up to the appearance of the pauvre mere they understood that th
ey had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an oppo
rtunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary went to her f
ather's room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the con
servatory.  Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation.
 It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided
 that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She read this in Ti
khon's face and in that of Prince Vasili's valet, who made her a low bow when she
 met him in the corridor carrying hot water.  The old prince was very affectionat
e and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well k
new this painstaking expression of her father's. His face wore that expression wh
en his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithme
tic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her, repeating in a low v
oice the same words several times over.  He came to the point at once, treating h
er ceremoniously.  "I have had a proposition made me concerning you," he said wit
h an unnatural smile. "I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasili has not come 
and brought his pupil with him" for some reason Prince Bolkonski referred to Anat
ole as a "pupil" "for the sake of my beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was
 made me on your account and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you."  "Ho
w am I to understand you, mon pere?" said the princess, growing pale and then blu
shing.  "How understand me!" cried her father angrily. "Prince Vasili finds you t
o his taste as a daughterinlaw and makes a proposal to you on his pupil's behalf.
 That's how it's to be understood! 'How understand it'!... And I ask you!"  "I do
 not know what you think, Father," whispered the princess.  "I? I? What of me? Le
ave me out of the question. I'm not going to get married. What about you? That's 
what I want to know."  The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with 
disapproval, but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would b
e decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under whic
h she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to submit from habit,
 and she said "I wish only to do your will, but if I had to express my own desire
..." She had no time to finish. The old prince interrupted her.  "That's admirabl
e!" he shouted. "He will take you with your dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne
 into the bargain. She'll be the wife, while you..."  The prince stopped. He saw 
the effect these words had produced on his daughter. She lowered her head and was
 ready to burst into tears.  "Now then, now then, I'm only joking!" he said. "Rem
ember this, Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to c
hoose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your life's happiness depends on yo
ur decision. Never mind me!"  "But I do not know, Father!"  "There's no need to t
alk! He receives his orders and will marry you or anybody but you are free to cho
ose.... Go to your room, think it over, and come back in an hour and tell me in h
is presence yes or no. I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but 
you had better think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!" he still shou
ted when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the stud
y.  Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said about 
Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but still it was t
errible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was going straight on through
 the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing anything, when suddenly the wellkno
wn whispering of Mademoiselle Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two
 steps away saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her
. With a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess Ma
ry, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle Bourienne who
 had not yet seen her.  "Who's that? Why? Wait a moment!" Anatole's face seemed t
o say. Princess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At l
ast Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to Princess 
Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange inci
dent, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apart
ments.  An hour later, Tikhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince he add
ed that Prince Vasili was also there. When Tikhon came to her Princess Mary was s
itting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her
 arms and gently stroking her hair. The princess' beautiful eyes with all their f
ormer calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle B
ourienne's pretty face.  "No, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!" said
 Mademoiselle Bourienne.  "Why? I love you more than ever," said Princess Mary, "
and I will try to do all I can for your happiness."  "But you despise me. You who
 are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion. Oh, only my p
oor mother..."  "I quite understand," answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile. "
Calm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father," she said, and went out.  Prince 
Vasili, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand, was s
itting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face, as if stirred to his heart
's core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility, when Princess
 Mary entered. He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff.  "Ah, my dear, my dear!" he be
gan, rising and taking her by both hands. Then, sighing, he added "My son's fate 
is in your hands. Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved a
s a daughter!"  He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.  "Fr... fr..." 
snorted Prince Bolkonski. "The prince is making a proposition to you in his pupil
'sI mean, his son'sname. Do you wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kuragin's wife? 
Reply yes or no," he shouted, "and then I shall reserve the right to state my opi
nion also. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion," added Prince Bolkonski, turning
 to Prince Vasili and answering his imploring look. "Yes, or no?"  "My desire is 
never to leave you, Father, never to separate my life from yours. I don't wish to
 marry," she answered positively, glancing at Prince Vasili and at her father wit
h her beautiful eyes.  "Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!" cried Prince B
olkonski, frowning and taking his daughter's hand he did not kiss her, but only b
ending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so that she win
ced and uttered a cry.  Prince Vasili rose.  "My dear, I must tell you that this 
is a moment I shall never, never forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a lit
tle hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous? Say 'perhaps'... The futur
e is so long. Say 'perhaps.'"  "Prince, what I have said is all there is in my he
art. I thank you for the honor, but I shall never be your son's wife."  "Well, so
 that's finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have seen you. Very glad! Go 
back to your rooms, Princess. Go!" said the old prince. "Very, very glad to have 
seen you," repeated he, embracing Prince Vasili.  "My vocation is a different one
," thought Princess Mary. "My vocation is to be happy with another kind of happin
ess, the happiness of love and selfsacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrang
e poor Amelie's happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so passionately rep
ents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between them. If he is not rich I 
will give her the means I will ask my father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when
 she is his wife. She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God
, how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps 
I might have done the same!..." thought Princess Mary.      CHAPTER VI   It was l
ong since the Rostovs had news of Nicholas. Not till midwinter was the count at l
ast handed a letter addressed in his son's handwriting. On receiving it, he ran o
n tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste, trying to escape notice, closed the doo
r, and began to read the letter.  Anna Mikhaylovna, who always knew everything th
at passed in the house, on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into 
the room and found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the sam
e time.  Anna Mikhaylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still livin
g with the Rostovs.  "My dear friend?" said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, p
repared to sympathize in any way.  The count sobbed yet more.  "Nikolenka... a le
tter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling boy... the countess... promoted to 
be an officer... thank God... How tell the little countess!"  Anna Mikhaylovna sa
t down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and fr
om the letter, then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count, and decide
d that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, 
with God's help, would inform her.  At dinner Anna Mikhaylovna talked the whole t
ime about the war news and about Nikolenka, twice asked when the last letter had 
been received from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they migh
t very likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these hints b
egan to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at An
na Mikhaylovna, the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant
 matters. Natasha, who, of the whole family, was the most gifted with a capacity 
to feel any shades of intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from 
the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her 
father and Anna Mikhaylovna, that it had something to do with her brother, and th
at Anna Mikhaylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as she was, Natasha, who knew
 how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nikolenka, did not venture 
to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat anything and kept 
wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess' remarks. After dinner, 
she rushed head long after Anna Mikhaylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on
 her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.  "Auntie, darling, do 
tell me what it is!"  "Nothing, my dear."  "No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won'
t give upI know you know something."  Anna Mikhaylovna shook her head.  "You are 
a little slyboots," she said.  "A letter from Nikolenka! I'm sure of it!" exclaim
ed Natasha, reading confirmation in Anna Mikhaylovna's face.  "But for God's sake
, be careful, you know how it may affect your mamma."  "I will, I will, only tell
 me! You won't? Then I will go and tell at once."  Anna Mikhaylovna, in a few wor
ds, told her the contents of the letter, on condition that she should tell no one
.  "No, on my true word of honor," said Natasha, crossing herself, "I won't tell 
anyone!" and she ran off at once to Sonya.  "Nikolenka... wounded... a letter," s
he announced in gleeful triumph.  "Nicholas!" was all Sonya said, instantly turni
ng white.  Natasha, seeing the impression the news of her brother's wound produce
d on Sonya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news.  She rushed t
o Sonya, hugged her, and began to cry.  "A little wound, but he has been made an 
officer he is well now, he wrote himself," said she through her tears.  "There no
w! It's true that all you women are crybabies," remarked Petya, pacing the room w
ith large, resolute strides. "Now I'm very glad, very glad indeed, that my brothe
r has distinguished himself so. You are all blubberers and understand nothing."  
Natasha smiled through her tears.  "You haven't read the letter?" asked Sonya.  "
No, but she said that it was all over and that he's now an officer."  "Thank God!
" said Sonya, crossing herself. "But perhaps she deceived you. Let us go to Mamma
."  Petya paced the room in silence for a time.  "If I'd been in Nikolenka's plac
e I would have killed even more of those Frenchmen," he said. "What nasty brutes 
they are! I'd have killed so many that there'd have been a heap of them."  "Hold 
your tongue, Petya, what a goose you are!"  "I'm not a goose, but they are who cr
y about trifles," said Petya.  "Do you remember him?" Natasha suddenly asked, aft
er a moment's silence.  Sonya smiled.  "Do I remember Nicholas?"  "No, Sonya, but
 do you remember so that you remember him perfectly, remember everything?" said N
atasha, with an expressive gesture, evidently wishing to give her words a very de
finite meaning. "I remember Nikolenka too, I remember him well," she said. "But I
 don't remember Boris. I don't remember him a bit."  "What! You don't remember Bo
ris?" asked Sonya in surprise.  "It's not that I don't rememberI know what he is 
like, but not as I remember Nikolenka. HimI just shut my eyes and remember, but B
oris... No!" She shut her eyes. "No! there's nothing at all."  "Oh, Natasha!" sai
d Sonya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consi
der her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to some
one else, with whom joking was out of the question, "I am in love with your broth
er once for all and, whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to lo
ve him as long as I live."  Natasha looked at Sonya with wondering and inquisitiv
e eyes, and said nothing. She felt that Sonya was speaking the truth, that there 
was such love as Sonya was speaking of. But Natasha had not yet felt anything lik
e it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.  "Shall you write to h
im?" she asked.  Sonya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to Nichola
s, and whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an offi
cer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself and, as it mig
ht seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on himself?  "I don't know. I thi
nk if he writes, I will write too," she said, blushing.  "And you won't feel asha
med to write to him?"  Sonya smiled.  "No."  "And I should be ashamed to write to
 Boris. I'm not going to."  "Why should you be ashamed?"  "Well, I don't know. It
's awkward and would make me ashamed."  "And I know why she'd be ashamed," said P
etya, offended by Natasha's previous remark. "It's because she was in love with t
hat fat one in spectacles" that was how Petya described his namesake, the new Cou
nt Bezukhov "and now she's in love with that singer" he meant Natasha's Italian s
inging master, "that's why she's ashamed!"  "Petya, you're a stupid!" said Natash
a.  "Not more stupid than you, madam," said the nineyearold Petya, with the air o
f an old brigadier.  The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikhaylovna's hints a
t dinner. On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on 
a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears kept co
ming into her eyes. Anna Mikhaylovna, with the letter, came on tiptoe to the coun
tess' door and paused.  "Don't come in," she said to the old count who was follow
ing her. "Come later." And she went in, closing the door behind her.  The count p
ut his ear to the keyhole and listened.  At first he heard the sound of indiffere
nt voices, then Anna Mikhaylovna's voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then
 silence, then both voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps. An
na Mikhaylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon w
ho has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate h
is skill.  "It is done!" she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the coun
tess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other
 the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.  When she saw the count, 
she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his bald head, over which she again l
ooked at the letter and the portrait, and in order to press them again to her lip
s, she slightly pushed away the bald head. Vera, Natasha, Sonya, and Petya now en
tered the room, and the reading of the letter began. After a brief description of
 the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his promotion, 
Nicholas said that he kissed his father's and mother's hands asking for their ble
ssing, and that he kissed Vera, Natasha, and Petya. Besides that, he sent greetin
gs to Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to kis
s for him "dear Sonya, whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever." When 
she heard this Sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable to bear
 the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall, whirled round it at f
ull speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon, and, flushed and smiling, plu
mped down on the floor. The countess was crying.  "Why are you crying, Mamma?" as
ked Vera. "From all he says one should be glad and not cry."  This was quite true
, but the count, the countess, and Natasha looked at her reproachfully. "And who 
is it she takes after?" thought the countess.  Nicholas' letter was read over hun
dreds of times, and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to th
e countess, for she did not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nur
ses, and Dmitri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter ea
ch time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of Nikole
nka's virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how joyful it seemed, that her son
, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years a
go within her, that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulge
nt count, that son who had first learned to say "pear" and then "granny," that th
is son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly wa
rrior doing some kind of man's work of his own, without help or guidance. The uni
versal experience of ages, showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the c
radle to manhood, did not exist for the countess. Her son's growth toward manhood
, at each of its stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never
 existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty year
s before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under
 her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she could 
not believe that that little creature could be this strong, brave man, this model
 son and officer that, judging by this letter, he now was.  "What a style! How ch
armingly he describes!" said she, reading the descriptive part of the letter. "An
d what a soul! Not a word about himself.... Not a word! About some Denisov or oth
er, though he himself, I dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing ab
out his sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered e
verybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was only so highI always s
aid...."  For more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of lett
ers to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out, while under t
he supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count, money and all thi
ngs necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer wer
e collected. Anna Mikhaylovna, practical woman that she was, had even managed by 
favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for her
self and her son. She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand Duke 
Constantine Pavlovich, who commanded the Guards. The Rostovs supposed that The Ru
ssian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address, and that if a letter reached 
the Grand Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should not rea
ch the Pavlograd regiment, which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhoo
d. And so it was decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke's courie
r to Boris and Boris was to forward them to Nicholas. The letters were from the o
ld count, the countess, Petya, Vera, Natasha, and Sonya, and finally there were s
ix thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to 
his son.      CHAPTER VII   On the twelfth of November, Kutuzov's active army, in
 camp before Olmutz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperorsthe
 Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent the night 
ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come straight to the review, reach
ing the field at Olmutz by ten o'clock.  That day Nicholas Rostov received a lett
er from Boris, telling him that the Ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night
 ten miles from Olmutz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money
 for him. Rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops, after the
ir active service, were stationed near Olmutz and the camp swarmed with wellprovi
sioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting wares. The Pavlog
rads held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had received for the campaig
n, and made expeditions to Olmutz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian, who 
had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses. Rostov, who had 
just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought Denisov's horse, Bedouin, 
was in debt all round, to his comrades and the sutlers. On receiving Boris' lette
r he rode with a fellow officer to Olmutz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, a
nd then set off alone to the Guards' camp to find his old playmate. Rostov had no
t yet had time to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated wit
h a soldier's cross, equally shabby cadet's riding breeches lined with worn leath
er, and an officer's saber with a sword knot. The Don horse he was riding was one
 he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign, and he wore a crumpled hussar 
cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head. As he rode up to the camp he tho
ught how he would impress Boris and all his comrades of the Guards by his appeara
ncethat of a fighting hussar who had been under fire.  The Guards had made their 
whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading their cleanliness and discipline. 
They had come by easy stages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian
 authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting pla
ce. The regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by 
the Grand Duke's orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on whi
ch the Guards prided themselves, the officers on foot and at their proper posts. 
Boris had been quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg who was already 
in command of a company. Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign
, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and 
had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily. Boris, during the campaign, h
ad made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by a 
letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become acquainted with Pr
ince Andrew Bolkonski, through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in
 chief's staff. Berg and Boris, having rested after yesterday's march, were sitti
ng, clean and neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to 
them, playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. Boris, in the ac
curate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of chessmen with 
his delicate white fingers while awaiting Berg's move, and watched his opponent's
 face, evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he
 was engaged on.  "Well, how are you going to get out of that?" he remarked.  "We
'll try to," replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing his hand.  At that m
oment the door opened.  "Here he is at last!" shouted Rostov. "And Berg too! Oh, 
you petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!" he exclaimed, imitating his Russian nurse'
s French, at which he and Boris used to laugh long ago.  "Dear me, how you have c
hanged!"  Boris rose to meet Rostov, but in doing so did not omit to steady and r
eplace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his friend, but N
icholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth, that dread of beaten tr
acks, and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders wh
ich is often insincere, Nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his fr
iend. He wanted to pinch him, push him, do anything but kiss hima thing everybody
 did. But notwithstanding this, Boris embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and k
issed him three times.  They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the
 age when young men take their first steps on life's road, each saw immense chang
es in the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken th
ose first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a 
hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.  "Oh, you damned dandies!
 Clean and fresh as if you'd been to a fete, not like us sinners of the line," cr
ied Rostov, with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice, new to Bor
is, pointing to his own mudbespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Ros
tov's loud voice, popped her head in at the door.  "Eh, is she pretty?" he asked 
with a wink.  "Why do you shout so? You'll frighten them!" said Boris. "I did not
 expect you today," he added. "I only sent you the note yesterday by Bolkonskian 
adjutant of Kutuzov's, who's a friend of mine. I did not think he would get it to
 you so quickly.... Well, how are you? Been under fire already?" asked Boris.  Wi
thout answering, Rostov shook the soldier's Cross of St. George fastened to the c
ording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm, glanced at Berg with a smil
e.  "As you see," he said.  "Indeed? Yes, yes!" said Boris, with a smile. "And we
 too have had a splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness r
ode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every advant
age. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls! I can't tell you. 
And the Tsarevich was very gracious to all our officers."  And the two friends to
ld each other of their doings, the one of his hussar revels and life in the fight
ing line, the other of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of t
he Imperial family.  "Oh, you Guards!" said Rostov. "I say, send for some wine." 
 Boris made a grimace.  "If you really want it," said he.  He went to his bed, dr
ew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent for wine.  "Yes, and I have some
 money and a letter to give you," he added.  Rostov took the letter and, throwing
 the money on the sofa, put both arms on the table and began to read. After readi
ng a few lines, he glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face 
behind the letter.  "Well, they've sent you a tidy sum," said Berg, eying the hea
vy purse that sank into the sofa. "As for us, Count, we get along on our pay. I c
an tell you for myself..."  "I say, Berg, my dear fellow," said Rostov, "when you
 get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk eve
rything over with, and I happen to be there, I'll go at once, to be out of your w
ay! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!" he exclaimed, and immediately sei
zing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, evidently wishing to 
soften the rudeness of his words, he added, "Don't be hurt, my dear fellow you kn
ow I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance."  "Oh, don't mention it, Coun
t! I quite understand," said Berg, getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttu
ral voice.  "Go across to our hosts they invited you," added Boris.  Berg put on 
the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust, stood before a looking gl
ass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards, in the way affected by the Emper
or Alexander, and, having assured himself from the way Rostov looked at it that h
is coat had been noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.  "Oh dear, what a 
beast I am!" muttered Rostov, as he read the letter.  "Why?"  "Oh, what a pig I a
m, not to have written and to have given them such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!
" he repeated, flushing suddenly. "Well, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All
 right let's have some!"  In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of
 recommendation to Bagration which the old countess at Anna Mikhaylovna's advice 
had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take it t
o its destination and make use of it.  "What nonsense! Much I need it!" said Rost
ov, throwing the letter under the table.  "Why have you thrown that away?" asked 
Boris.  "It is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it for!"
  "Why 'What the devil'?" said Boris, picking it up and reading the address. "Thi
s letter would be of great use to you."  "I want nothing, and I won't be anyone's
 adjutant."  "Why not?" inquired Boris.  "It's a lackey's job!"  "You are still t
he same dreamer, I see," remarked Boris, shaking his head.  "And you're still the
 same diplomatist! But that's not the point... Come, how are you?" asked Rostov. 
 "Well, as you see. So far everything's all right, but I confess I should much li
ke to be an adjutant and not remain at the front."  "Why?"  "Because when once a 
man starts on military service, he should try to make as successful a career of i
t as possible."  "Oh, that's it!" said Rostov, evidently thinking of something el
se.  He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes, evidently trying 
in vain to find the answer to some question.  Old Gabriel brought in the wine.  "
Shouldn't we now send for Berg?" asked Boris. "He would drink with you. I can't."
  "Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?" asked Rostov, w
ith a contemptuous smile.  "He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,
" answered Boris.  Again Rostov looked intently into Boris' eyes and sighed. Berg
 returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers be
came animated. The Guardsmen told Rostov of their march and how they had been mad
e much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke of the sayings and doings of 
their commander, the Grand Duke, and told stories of his kindness and irascibilit
y. Berg, as usual, kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself, but in
 connection with the stories of the Grand Duke's quick temper he related with gus
to how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made
 a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement. With 
a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violen
t passion, shouting "Arnauts!" "Arnauts" was the Tsarevich's favorite expression 
when he was in a rage and called for the company commander.  "Would you believe i
t, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew I was right. Without boasting,
 you know, I may say that I know the Army Orders by heart and know the Regulation
s as well as I do the Lord's Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in 
my company, and so my conscience was at ease. I came forward...." Berg stood up a
nd showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really it would
 have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and selfcomplacency th
an his did. "Well, he stormed at me, as the saying is, stormed and stormed and st
ormed! It was not a matter of life but rather of death, as the saying is. 'Albani
ans!' and 'devils!' and 'To Siberia!'" said Berg with a sagacious smile. "I knew 
I was in the right so I kept silent was not that best, Count?... 'Hey, are you du
mb?' he shouted. Still I remained silent. And what do you think, Count? The next 
day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of the Day. That's what keeping one's
 head means. That's the way, Count," said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting ri
ngs of smoke.  "Yes, that was fine," said Rostov, smiling.  But Boris noticed tha
t he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and skillfully changed the subject. He as
ked him to tell them how and where he got his wound. This pleased Rostov and he b
egan talking about it, and as he went on became more and more animated. He told t
hem of his Schon Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle ge
nerally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been, as they have
 heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not at all as it really wa
s. Rostov was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate
 lie. He began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened, but impe
rceptibly, involuntarily, and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told
 the truth to his hearerswho like himself had often heard stories of attacks and 
had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just 
such a storythey would either not have believed him or, still worse, would have t
hought that Rostov was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narra
tors of cavalry attacks had not happened to him. He could not tell them simply th
at everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm an
d then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell e
verything as it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort o
f will to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth, and yo
ung people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story of how beside h
imself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, c
ut his way in, slashed right and left, how his saber had tasted flesh and he had 
fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he told them all that.  In the middle of his 
story, just as he was saying "You cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experi
ences during an attack," Prince Andrew, whom Boris was expecting, entered the roo
m. Prince Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for h
is assistance and being well disposed toward Boris, who had managed to please him
 the day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent with
 papers from Kutuzov to the Tsarevich, he looked in on Boris, hoping to find him 
alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military expl
oits Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man, he gave Boris a pleasant sm
ile, frowned as with halfclosed eyes he looked at Rostov, bowed slightly and wear
ily, and sat down languidly on the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in 
on bad company. Rostov flushed up on noticing this, but he did not care, this was
 a mere stranger. Glancing, however, at Boris, he saw that he too seemed ashamed 
of the hussar of the line.  In spite of Prince Andrew's disagreeable, ironical to
ne, in spite of the contempt with which Rostov, from his fighting army point of v
iew, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was ev
idently one, Rostov felt confused, blushed, and became silent. Boris inquired wha
t news there might be on the staff, and what, without indiscretion, one might ask
 about our plans.  "We shall probably advance," replied Bolkonski, evidently relu
ctant to say more in the presence of a stranger.  Berg took the opportunity to as
k, with great politeness, whether, as was rumored, the allowance of forage money 
to captains of companies would be doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a 
smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order, and Be
rg laughed gaily.  "As to your business," Prince Andrew continued, addressing Bor
is, "we will talk of it later" and he looked round at Rostov. "Come to me after t
he review and we will do what is possible."  And, having glanced round the room, 
Prince Andrew turned to Rostov, whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassme
nt now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice, and said "I think you w
ere talking of the Schon Grabern affair? Were you there?"  "I was there," said Ro
stov angrily, as if intending to insult the aidedecamp.  Bolkonski noticed the hu
ssar's state of mind, and it amused him. With a slightly contemptuous smile, he s
aid "Yes, there are many stories now told about that affair!"  "Yes, stories!" re
peated Rostov loudly, looking with eyes suddenly grown furious, now at Boris, now
 at Bolkonski. "Yes, many stories! But our stories are the stories of men who hav
e been under the enemy's fire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories
 of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!"  "Of whom
 you imagine me to be one?" said Prince Andrew, with a quiet and particularly ami
able smile.  A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man's 
selfpossession mingled at that moment in Rostov's soul.  "I am not talking about 
you," he said, "I don't know you and, frankly, I don't want to. I am speaking of 
the staff in general."  "And I will tell you this," Prince Andrew interrupted in 
a tone of quiet authority, "you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with y
ou that it would be very easy to do so if you haven't sufficient selfrespect, but
 admit that the time and place are very badly chosen. In a day or two we shall al
l have to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and besides, Drubetskoy, 
who says he is an old friend of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has th
e misfortune to displease you. However," he added rising, "you know my name and w
here to find me, but don't forget that I do not regard either myself or you as ha
ving been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my advice is to let the m
atter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review I shall expect you, Drubetskoy.
 Au revoir!" exclaimed Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them both he went out.  O
nly when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostov think of what he ought to have said. A
nd he was still more angry at having omitted to say it. He ordered his horse at o
nce and, coldly taking leave of Boris, rode home. Should he go to headquarters ne
xt day and challenge that affected adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was t
he question that worried him all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he w
ould have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered
 by his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there 
was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he
 so hated.      CHAPTER VIII   The day after Rostov had been to see Boris, a revi
ew was held of the Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from R
ussia and those who had been campaigning under Kutuzov. The two Emperors, the Rus
sian with his heir the Tsarevich, and the Austrian with the Archduke, inspected t
he allied army of eighty thousand men.  From early morning the smart clean troops
 were on the move, forming up on the field before the fortress. Now thousands of 
feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers' command, turned with banners 
flying, formed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of infantr
y in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling
 of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided uniforms, with smartly dressed 
bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or gray horses then again, spreading ou
t with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun
 carriages and with the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled betw
een the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the gen
erals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the ut
most, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and wearing scarves and 
all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier 
with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the
 utmost, and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of
 its wetted mane lay smoothfelt that no small matter was happening, but an import
ant and solemn affair. Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own i
nsignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and yet at the sam
e time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole.  From earl
y morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten o'clock all had b
een brought into due order. The ranks were drawn up on the vast field. The whole 
army was extended in three lines the cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, a
nd behind that again the infantry.  A space like a street was left between each t
wo lines of troops. The three parts of that army were sharply distinguished Kutuz
ov's fighting army with the Pavlograds on the right flank of the front those rece
ntly arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the line and the Austrian 
troops. But they all stood in the same lines, under one command, and in a like or
der.  Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper "They're coming! They're comin
g!" Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final preparation swept over all the
 troops.  From the direction of Olmutz in front of them, a group was seen approac
hing. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust of wind blowing 
over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded stand
ards fluttered against their staffs. It looked as if by that slight motion the ar
my itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was h
eard shouting "Eyes front!" Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was 
repeated by others from various sides and all became silent.  In the deathlike st
illness only the tramp of horses was heard. This was the Emperors' suites. The Em
perors rode up to the flank, and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment playe
d the general march. It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as 
if the army itself, rejoicing at the Emperors' approach, had naturally burst into
 music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor Alexande
r was clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the first regiment roared
 "Hurrah!" so deafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that the men themselves wer
e awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted.  Rosto
v, standing in the front lines of Kutuzov's army which the Tsar approached first,
 experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army a feeling of selffo
rgetfulness, a proud consciousness of might, and a passionate attraction to him w
ho was the cause of this triumph.  He felt that at a single word from that man al
l this vast mass and he himself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire
 and water, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he cou
ld not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.  "Hur
rah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" thundered from all sides, one regiment after another greeti
ng the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then "Hurrah!"... Then the general
 march, and again "Hurrah! Hurrah!" growing ever stronger and fuller and merging 
into a deafening roar.  Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence an
d immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became ali
ve, its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already pas
sed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices, amid the square mas
ses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders compo
sing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely, and in f
ront of them two menthe Emperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate att
ention of that whole mass of men was concentrated.  The handsome young Emperor Al
exander, in the uniform of the Horse Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks 
front and back, with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attrac
ted everyone's attention.  Rostov was not far from the trumpeters, and with his k
een sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within tw
enty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome, 
happy young face, he experienced a feeling tenderness and ecstasy such as he had 
never before known. Every trait and every movement of the Tsar's seemed to him en
chanting.  Stopping in front of the Pavlograds, the Tsar said something in French
 to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.  Seeing that smile, Rostov involuntarily smi
led himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed t
o show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cr
y. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.  "Oh 
God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?" thought Rostov. "I shou
ld die of happiness!"  The Tsar addressed the officers also "I thank you all, gen
tlemen, I thank you with my whole heart." To Rostov every word sounded like a voi
ce from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!  "You have ea
rned the St. George's standards and will be worthy of them."  "Oh, to die, to die
 for him," thought Rostov.  The Tsar said something more which Rostov did not hea
r, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted "Hurrah!"  Rostov too, bendin
g over his saddle, shouted "Hurrah!" with all his might, feeling that he would li
ke to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully.  The Ts
ar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.  "How can the E
mperor be undecided?" thought Rostov, but then even this indecision appeared to h
im majestic and enchanting, like everything else the Tsar did.  That hesitation l
asted only an instant. The Tsar's foot, in the narrow pointed boot then fashionab
le, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glov
e gathered up the reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying s
ea of aidesdecamp. Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments,
 till at last only his white plumes were visible to Rostov from amid the suites t
hat surrounded the Emperors.  Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostov noticed Bo
lkonski, sitting his horse indolently and carelessly. Rostov recalled their quarr
el of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not t
o challenge Bolkonski. "Of course not!" he now thought. "Is it worth thinking or 
speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such love, such rapture, and such s
elfsacrifice, what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter? I love and forgive
 everybody now."  When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troop
s began a ceremonial march past him, and Rostov on Bedouin, recently purchased fr
om Denisov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadronthat is, alone and in full 
view of the Emperor.  Before he reached him, Rostov, who was a splendid horseman,
 spurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the an
imal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his tail extende
d, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor's eye upon him, passed splendidly
, lifting his feet with a high and graceful action, as if flying through the air 
without touching the ground.  Rostov himself, his legs well back and his stomach 
drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a fro
wning but blissful face "like a vewy devil," as Denisov expressed it.  "Fine fell
ows, the Pavlograds!" remarked the Emperor.  "My God, how happy I should be if he
 ordered me to leap into the fire this instant!" thought Rostov.  When the review
 was over, the newly arrived officers, and also Kutuzov's, collected in groups an
d began to talk about the awards, about the Austrians and their uniforms, about t
heir lines, about Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially 
if the Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.  But the talk in every grou
p was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His every word and movement was descri
bed with ecstasy.  They all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible again
st the enemy under the Emperor's command. Commanded by the Emperor himself they c
ould not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might so thought Rostov and most 
of the officers after the review.  All were then more confident of victory than t
he winning of two battles would have made them.      CHAPTER IX   The day after t
he review, Boris, in his best uniform and with his comrade Berg's best wishes for
 success, rode to Olmutz to see Bolkonski, wishing to profit by his friendliness 
and obtain for himself the best post he couldpreferably that of adjutant to some 
important personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive. 
"It is all very well for Rostov, whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a 
time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone's lackey, 
but I who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and must not miss oppo
rtunities, but must avail myself of them!" he reflected.  He did not find Prince 
Andrew in Olmutz that day, but the appearance of the town where the headquarters 
and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two Emperors were living with the
ir suites, households, and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that 
higher world.  He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman's uniform, all the
se exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with thei
r plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military men, seemed so immeasu
rably above him, an insignificant officer of the Guards, that they not only did n
ot wish to, but simply could not, be aware of his existence. At the quarters of t
he commander in chief, Kutuzov, where he inquired for Bolkonski, all the adjutant
s and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a
 great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was hea
rtily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather because of it, next day, November
 15, after dinner he again went to Olmutz and, entering the house occupied by Kut
uzov, asked for Bolkonski. Prince Andrew was in and Boris was shown into a large 
hall probably formerly used for dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and fu
rniture of various kinds a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest
 the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing. Another,
 the red, stout Nesvitski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head, laughing wi
th an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was playing a Viennese waltz o
n the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on the clavichord, sang the tune. Bolkons
ki was not there. None of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing Boris. T
he one who was writing and whom Boris addressed turned round crossly and told him
 Bolkonski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into th
e reception room if he wished to see him. Boris thanked him and went to the recep
tion room, where he found some ten officers and generals.  When he entered, Princ
e Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously with that peculiar expression of polit
e weariness which plainly says, "If it were not my duty I would not talk to you f
or a moment", was listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood
 very erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier's obsequious expression on his purp
le face, reporting something.  "Very well, then, be so good as to wait," said Pri
nce Andrew to the general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he aff
ected when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Boris, Prince Andrew, 
paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear someth
ing more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile.  At that moment Boris c
learly realized what he had before surmised, that in the army, besides the subord
ination and discipline prescribed in the military code, which he and the others k
new in the regiment, there was another, more important, subordination, which made
 this tightlaced, purplefaced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andr
ew, for his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetskoy. More than eve
r was Boris resolved to serve in future not according to the written code, but un
der this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having been recommended to Pri
nce Andrew he had already risen above the general who at the front had the power 
to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the Guards. Prince Andrew came up to him and t
ook his hand.  "I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing a
bout with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions. Whe
n Germans start being accurate, there's no end to it!"  Boris smiled, as if he un
derstood what Prince Andrew was alluding to as something generally known. But it 
was the first time he had heard Weyrother's name, or even the term "dispositions.
"  "Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have been thinki
ng about you."  "Yes, I was thinking"for some reason Boris could not help blushin
g"of asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from Prince Kuragin about
 me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards won't be in action," he added
 as if in apology.  "All right, all right. We'll talk it over," replied Prince An
drew. "Only let me report this gentleman's business, and I shall be at your dispo
sal."  While Prince Andrew went to report about the purplefaced general, that gen
tlemanevidently not sharing Boris' conception of the advantages of the unwritten 
code of subordinationlooked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had pre
vented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that Boris felt uncomfort
able. He turned away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrew's return from the c
ommander in chief's room.  "You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about y
ou," said Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavicho
rd was. "It's no use your going to the commander in chief. He would say a lot of 
pleasant things, ask you to dinner" "That would not be bad as regards the unwritt
en code," thought Boris, "but nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a
 battalion of us aidesdecamp and adjutants! But this is what we'll do I have a go
od friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince Dolgorukov and tho
ugh you may not know it, the fact is that now Kutuzov with his staff and all of u
s count for nothing. Everything is now centered round the Emperor. So we will go 
to Dolgorukov I have to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about yo
u. We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you s
omewhere nearer the sun."  Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had
 to guide a young man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining h
elp of this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for himself,
 he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him. 
He very readily took up Boris' cause and went with him to Dolgorukov.  It was lat
e in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmutz occupied by the Emperors 
and their retinues.  That same day a council of war had been held in which all th
e members of the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, cont
rary to the views of the old generals Kutuzov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it had b
een decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte. The council of w
ar was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Boris arrived at the palace to
 find Dolgorukov. Everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the day's
 council, at which the party of the young had triumphed. The voices of those who 
counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been 
so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence o
f the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the councilthe comi
ng battle and the victory that would certainly result from itno longer seemed to 
be in the future but in the past. All the advantages were on our side. Our enormo
us forces, undoubtedly superior to Napoleon's, were concentrated in one place, th
e troops inspired by the Emperors' presence were eager for action. The strategic 
position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to
 the Austrian General Weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that the Austrian a
rmy should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the French had now
 to be fought the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the ma
ps, and Bonaparte, evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.  Dolgorukov, one 
of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just returned from the council, tired 
and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained. Prince And
rew introduced his protege, but Prince Dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing hi
s hand said nothing to Boris and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which
 were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew in French.  "
Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that the one that wil
l result from it will be as victorious! However, dear fellow," he said abruptly a
nd eagerly, "I must confess to having been unjust to the Austrians and especially
 to Weyrother. What exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, 
what foresight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest deta
il! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones could have bee
n devised. This combination of Austrian precision with Russian valorwhat more cou
ld be wished for?"  "So the attack is definitely resolved on?" asked Bolkonski.  
"And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has decidedly los
t bearings, you know that a letter was received from him today for the Emperor." 
Dolgorukov smiled significantly.  "Is that so? And what did he say?" inquired Bol
konski.  "What can he say? Tradiridira and so on... merely to gain time. I tell y
ou he is in our hands, that's certain! But what was most amusing," he continued, 
with a sudden, goodnatured laugh, "was that we could not think how to address the
 reply! If not as 'Consul' and of course not as 'Emperor,' it seemed to me it sho
uld be to 'General Bonaparte.'"  "But between not recognizing him as Emperor and 
calling him General Bonaparte, there is a difference," remarked Bolkonski.  "That
's just it," interrupted Dolgorukov quickly, laughing. "You know Bilibinhe's a ve
ry clever fellow. He suggested addressing him as 'Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.'"
  Dolgorukov laughed merrily.  "Only that?" said Bolkonski.  "All the same, it wa
s Bilibin who found a suitable form for the address. He is a wise and clever fell
ow."  "What was it?"  "To the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvern
ement francais," said Dolgorukov, with grave satisfaction. "Good, wasn't it?"  "Y
es, but he will dislike it extremely," said Bolkonski.  "Oh yes, very much! My br
other knows him, he's dined with himthe present Emperormore than once in Paris, a
nd tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatistyou know, a combinat
ion of French adroitness and Italian playacting! Do you know the tale about him a
nd Count Markov? Count Markov was the only man who knew how to handle him. You kn
ow the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!"  And the talkative Dolgoruko
v, turning now to Boris, now to Prince Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test
 Markov, our ambassador, purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and sto
od looking at Markov, probably expecting Markov to pick it up for him, and how Ma
rkov immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching Bona
parte's.  "Delightful!" said Bolkonski. "But I have come to you, Prince, as a pet
itioner on behalf of this young man. You see..." but before Prince Andrew could f
inish, an aidedecamp came in to summon Dolgorukov to the Emperor.  "Oh, what a nu
isance," said Dolgorukov, getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of Prince A
ndrew and Boris. "You know I should be very glad to do all in my power both for y
ou and for this dear young man." Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an 
expression of goodnatured, sincere, and animated levity. "But you see... another 
time!"  Boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers a
s he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here he was in cont
act with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of whi
ch in his regiment he felt himself a tiny, obedient, and insignificant atom. They
 followed Prince Dolgorukov out into the corridor and metcoming out of the door o
f the Emperor's room by which Dolgorukov had entereda short man in civilian cloth
es with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling his face
, gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression. This short man nodde
d to Dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool in
tensity, walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to ste
p out of his way. Prince Andrew did neither a look of animosity appeared on his f
ace and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor.  "Who was t
hat?" asked Boris.  "He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant 
of menthe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartoryski.... It is such men
 as he who decide the fate of nations," added Bolkonski with a sigh he could not 
suppress, as they passed out of the palace.  Next day, the army began its campaig
n, and up to the very battle of Austerlitz, Boris was unable to see either Prince
 Andrew or Dolgorukov again and remained for a while with the Ismaylov regiment. 
     CHAPTER X   At dawn on the sixteenth of November, Denisov's squadron, in whi
ch Nicholas Rostov served and which was in Prince Bagration's detachment, moved f
rom the place where it had spent the night, advancing into action as arranged, an
d after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on 
the highroad. Rostov saw the Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of 
hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Gen
erals Bagration and Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear befor
e action which he had experienced as previously, all the inner struggle to conque
r that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this ba
ttle, had been wasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and Nicholas Rostov spe
nt that day in a dull and wretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard firing 
in front and shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back there were not 
many of them, and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French cavalry was bro
ught in, convoyed by a sotnya of Cossacks. Evidently the affair was over and, tho
ugh not big, had been a successful engagement. The men and officers returning spo
ke of a brilliant victory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau and the captu
re of a whole French squadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night f
rost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of
 victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken part in
 it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, genera
ls, and adjutants, as they passed Rostov going or coming. And Nicholas, who had v
ainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day 
in inactivity, was all the more depressed.  "Come here, Wostov. Let's dwink to dw
own our gwief!" shouted Denisov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flas
k and some food.  The officers gathered round Denisov's canteen, eating and talki
ng.  "There! They are bringing another!" cried one of the officers, indicating a 
captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two Cossacks.  One of 
them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had taken from the pr
isoner.  "Sell us that horse!" Denisov called out to the Cossacks.  "If you like,
 your honor!"  The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisone
r. The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German accent.
 He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when he heard some Frenc
h spoken he at once began speaking to the officers, addressing first one, then an
other. He said he would not have been taken, it was not his fault but the corpora
l's who had sent him to seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russia
ns were there. And at every word he added "But don't hurt my little horse!" and s
troked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was. Now he 
excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now, imagining himself before 
his own officers, insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service. H
e brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the Fren
ch army, which was so alien to us.  The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold piec
es, and Rostov, being the richest of the officers now that he had received his mo
ney, bought it.  "But don't hurt my little horse!" said the Alsatian goodnaturedl
y to Rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar.  Rostov smilingly reas
sured the dragoon and gave him money.  "Alley! Alley!" said the Cossack, touching
 the prisoner's arm to make him go on.  "The Emperor! The Emperor!" was suddenly 
heard among the hussars.  All began to run and bustle, and Rostov saw coming up t
he road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment ev
eryone was in his place, waiting.  Rostov did not know or remember how he ran to 
his place and mounted. Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his 
dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought 
of himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to the Empe
ror. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost.
 He was happy as a lover when the longedfor moment of meeting arrives. Not daring
 to look round and without looking round, he was ecstatically conscious of his ap
proach. He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalc
ade, but because as he drew near everything grew brighter, more joyful, more sign
ificant, and more festive around him. Nearer and nearer to Rostov came that sun s
hedding beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself enve
loped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm, and majestic voice t
hat was yet so simple! And as if in accord with Rostov's feeling, there was a dea
thly stillness amid which was heard the Emperor's voice.  "The Pavlograd hussars?
" he inquired.  "The reserves, sire!" replied a voice, a very human one compared 
to that which had said "The Pavlograd hussars?"  The Emperor drew level with Rost
ov and halted. Alexander's face was even more beautiful than it had been three da
ys before at the review. It shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth
, that it suggested the liveliness of a fourteenyearold boy, and yet it was the f
ace of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the Emperor'
s eyes met Rostov's and rested on them for not more than two seconds. Whether or 
no the Emperor understood what was going on in Rostov's soul it seemed to Rostov 
that he understood everything, at any rate his lightblue eyes gazed for about two
 seconds into Rostov's face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at o
nce he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and ga
lloped on.  The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the 
battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve o'clock lef
t the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard. Befor
e he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met him with news of the success
ful result of the action.  This battle, which consisted in the capture of a Frenc
h squadron, was represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the Em
peror and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield, b
elieved that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their will.
 A few minutes after the Emperor had passed, the Pavlograd division was ordered t
o advance. In Wischau itself, a petty German town, Rostov saw the Emperor again. 
In the market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the Emp
eror's arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been t
ime to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers, was 
riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden a
t the review, and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his 
eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The
 wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity to the Em
peror shocked Rostov. Rostov saw how the Emperor's rather round shoulders shudder
ed as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left foot began convulsively ta
pping the horse's side with the spur, and how the welltrained horse looked round 
unconcerned and did not stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under 
the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned. 
 "Gently, gently! Can't you do it more gently?" said the Emperor apparently suffe
ring more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.  Rostov saw tears filling the
 Emperor's eyes and heard him, as he was riding away, say to Czartoryski "What a 
terrible thing war is what a terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!
"  The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight of the 
enemy's lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing. T
he Emperor's gratitude was announced to the vanguard, rewards were promised, and 
the men received a double ration of vodka. The campfires crackled and the soldier
s' songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night. Denisov celebrat
ed his promotion to the rank of major, and Rostov, who had already drunk enough, 
at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor's health. "Not 'our Sovereign, the E
mperor,' as they say at official dinners," said he, "but the health of our Sovere
ign, that good, enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the 
certain defeat of the French!"  "If we fought before," he said, "not letting the 
French pass, as at Schon Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the fron
t? We will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not sayi
ng it right, I have drunk a good dealbut that is how I feel, and so do you too! T
o the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!"  "Hurrah!" rang the enthusiastic vo
ices of the officers.  And the old cavalry captain, Kirsten, shouted enthusiastic
ally and no less sincerely than the twentyyearold Rostov.  When the officers had 
emptied and smashed their glasses, Kirsten filled others and, in shirt sleeves an
d breeches, went glass in hand to the soldiers' bonfires and with his long gray m
ustache, his white chest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pos
e in the light of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.  "Lads! here's to our So
vereign, the Emperor, and victory over our enemies! Hurrah!" he exclaimed in his 
dashing, old, hussar's baritone.  The hussars crowded round and responded heartil
y with loud shouts.  Late that night, when all had separated, Denisov with his sh
ort hand patted his favorite, Rostov, on the shoulder.  "As there's no one to fal
l in love with on campaign, he's fallen in love with the Tsar," he said.  "Deniso
v, don't make fun of it!" cried Rostov. "It is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, s
uch a..."  "I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove..."  "No,
 you don't understand!"  And Rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires
, dreaming of what happiness it would be to dienot in saving the Emperor's life h
e did not even dare to dream of that, but simply to die before his eyes. He reall
y was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of fut
ure triumph. And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those 
memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the R
ussian army were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the 
glory of the Russian arms.      CHAPTER XI   The next day the Emperor stopped at 
Wischau, and Villier, his physician, was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headq
uarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell.
 He ate nothing and had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The ca
use of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by
 the sight of the killed and wounded.  At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French o
fficer who had come with a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian 
Emperor, was brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The
 Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday he was 
admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with Prince Dolgorukov to 
the advanced post of the French army.  It was rumored that Savary had been sent t
o propose to Alexander a meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole
 army, a personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince Dol
gorukov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon i
f, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were actuated by a real desire fo
r peace.  Toward evening Dolgorukov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and rem
ained alone with him for a long time.  On the eighteenth and nineteenth of Novemb
er, the army advanced two days' march and the enemy's outposts after a brief inte
rchange of shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the ninete
enth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of
 the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz was fought.  Till midday 
on the nineteenth, the activitythe eager talk, running to and fro, and dispatchin
g of adjutantswas confined to the Emperor's headquarters. But on the afternoon of
 that day, this activity reached Kutuzov's headquarters and the staffs of the com
manders of columns. By evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts
 of the army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole ei
ghty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices, and th
e army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long.  The concentrated 
activity which had begun at the Emperor's headquarters in the morning and had sta
rted the whole movement that followed was like the first movement of the main whe
el of a large tower clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and
 a third, and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to 
work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with regular m
otion as a result of all that activity.  Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so 
in the mechanism of the military machine, an impulse once given leads to the fina
l result and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is trans
mitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reach
ed. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving 
pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a neighboring wheel is as 
quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years 
but the moment comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel
 begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of which are b
eyond its ken.  Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innum
erable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands whic
h show the time, so the result of all the complicated human activities of 160,000
 Russians and Frenchall their passions, desires, remorse, humiliations, suffering
s, outbursts of pride, fear, and enthusiasmwas only the loss of the battle of Aus
terlitz, the socalled battle of the three Emperorsthat is to say, a slow movement
 of the hand on the dial of human history.  Prince Andrew was on duty that day an
d in constant attendance on the commander in chief.  At six in the evening, Kutuz
ov went to the Emperor's headquarters and after staying but a short time with the
 Tsar went to see the grand marshal of the court, Count Tolstoy.  Bolkonski took 
the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from Dolgorukov
. He felt that Kutuzov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at hea
dquarters they were dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor's headqua
rters everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do no
t know he therefore wished to speak to Dolgorukov.  "Well, how d'you do, my dear 
fellow?" said Dolgorukov, who was sitting at tea with Bilibin. "The fete is for t
omorrow. How is your old fellow? Out of sorts?"  "I won't say he is out of sorts,
 but I fancy he would like to be heard."  "But they heard him at the council of w
ar and will hear him when he talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something
 now when Bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible."  "Y
es, you have seen him?" said Prince Andrew. "Well, what is Bonaparte like? How di
d he impress you?"  "Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so mu
ch as a general engagement," repeated Dolgorukov, evidently prizing this general 
conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon. "If he weren
't afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview? Why negotiate, and above
 all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war?
 Believe me, he is afraid, afraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my
 words!"  "But tell me, what is he like, eh?" said Prince Andrew again.  "He is a
 man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him 'Your Majesty,' but 
who, to his chagrin, got no title from me! That's the sort of man he is, and noth
ing more," replied Dolgorukov, looking round at Bilibin with a smile.  "Despite m
y great respect for old Kutuzov," he continued, "we should be a nice set of fello
ws if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to escape, or to trick us, n
ow that we certainly have him in our hands! No, we mustn't forget Suvorov and his
 rulenot to put yourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Be
lieve me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all the e
xperience of old Cunctators."  "But in what position are we going to attack him? 
I have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief for
ces are situated," said Prince Andrew.  He wished to explain to Dolgorukov a plan
 of attack he had himself formed.  "Oh, that is all the same," Dolgorukov said qu
ickly, and getting up he spread a map on the table. "All eventualities have been 
foreseen. If he is standing before Brunn..."  And Prince Dolgorukov rapidly but i
ndistinctly explained Weyrother's plan of a flanking movement.  Prince Andrew beg
an to reply and to state his own plan, which might have been as good as Weyrother
's, but for the disadvantage that Weyrother's had already been approved. As soon 
as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of
 his own plan, Prince Dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absentmindedly
 not at the map, but at Prince Andrew's face.  "There will be a council of war at
 Kutuzov's tonight, though you can say all this there," remarked Dolgorukov.  "I 
will do so," said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.  "Whatever are you bot
hering about, gentlemen?" said Bilibin, who, till then, had listened with an amus
ed smile to their conversation and now was evidently ready with a joke. "Whether 
tomorrow brings victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Excep
t your Kutuzov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The command
ers are Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le
 Prince, de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on like all those Polish na
mes."  "Be quiet, backbiter!" said Dolgorukov. "It is not true there are now two 
Russians, Miloradovich, and Dokhturov, and there would be a third, Count Arakchee
v, if his nerves were not too weak."  "However, I think General Kutuzov has come 
out," said Prince Andrew. "I wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!" he added
 and went out after shaking hands with Dolgorukov and Bilibin.  On the way home, 
Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutuzov, who was sitting silently bes
ide him, what he thought of tomorrow's battle.  Kutuzov looked sternly at his adj
utant and, after a pause, replied "I think the battle will be lost, and so I told
 Count Tolstoy and asked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? '
But, my dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military mat
ters yourself!' Yes... That was the answer I got!"      CHAPTER XII   Shortly aft
er nine o'clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his plans to Kutuzov's quarter
s where the council of war was to be held. All the commanders of columns were sum
moned to the commander in chief's and with the exception of Prince Bagration, who
 declined to come, were all there at the appointed time.  Weyrother, who was in f
ull control of the proposed battle, by his eagerness and briskness presented a ma
rked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy Kutuzov, who reluctantly played the 
part of chairman and president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt hi
mself to be at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He 
was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was pulli
ng it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at headlong speed w
ith no time to consider what this movement might lead to. Weyrother had been twic
e that evening to the enemy's picket line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to
 the Emperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and explain, and to his headquarte
rs where he had dictated the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he 
arrived at Kutuzov's.  He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite 
to the commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly, w
ithout looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to questions put t
o him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful, weary, and distracted air, 
though at the same time he was haughty and selfconfident.  Kutuzov was occupying 
a nobleman's castle of modest dimensions near Ostralitz. In the large drawing roo
m which had become the commander in chief's office were gathered Kutuzov himself,
 Weyrother, and the members of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and on
ly awaited Prince Bagration to begin the council. At last Bagration's orderly cam
e with the news that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came in to inform
 the commander in chief of this and, availing himself of permission previously gi
ven him by Kutuzov to be present at the council, he remained in the room.  "Since
 Prince Bagration is not coming, we may begin," said Weyrother, hurriedly rising 
from his seat and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs 
of Brunn was spread out.  Kutuzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat ne
ck bulged over his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chai
r, with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound of We
yrother's voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.  "Yes, yes, if you please!
 It is already late," said he, and nodding his head he let it droop and again clo
sed his eye.  If at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzov was pre
tending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed pr
oved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more seriou
s matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else
he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep. He really was
 asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced 
at Kutuzov and, having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and 
in a loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending 
battle, under a heading which he also read out  "Dispositions for an attack on th
e enemy position behind Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805."  The disposi
tions were very complicated and difficult. They began as follows  "As the enemy's
 left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends along Kobelnitz and Sokoln
itz behind the ponds that are there, while we, on the other hand, with our left w
ing by far outflank his right, it is advantageous to attack the enemy's latter wi
ng especially if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we ca
n both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between Schlappanitz and t
he Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cov
er the enemy's front. For this object it is necessary that... The first column ma
rches... The second column marches... The third column marches..." and so on, rea
d Weyrother.  The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult disposit
ions. The tall, fairhaired General Buxhowden stood, leaning his back against the 
wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen or even to wis
h to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening wideop
en eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy Miloradovi
ch in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and hi
s shoulders raised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrother's face, an
d only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished reading. Th
en Miloradovich looked round significantly at the other generals. But one could n
ot tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfi
ed or not with the arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a
 subtle smile that never left his typically southern French face during the whole
 time of the reading, gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its 
corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the long
est sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised his head, and
 with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted Wey
rother, wishing to say something. But the Austrian general, continuing to read, f
rowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as if to say "You can tell me your views la
ter, but now be so good as to look at the map and listen." Langeron lifted his ey
es with an expression of perplexity, turned round to Miloradovich as if seeking a
n explanation, but meeting the latter's impressive but meaningless gaze drooped h
is eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.  "A geography lesson!" he 
muttered as if to himself, but loud enough to be heard.  Przebyszewski, with resp
ectful but dignified politeness, held his hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with 
the air of a man absorbed in attention. Dohkturov, a little man, sat opposite Wey
rother, with an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map co
nscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He asked Weyr
other several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult na
mes of villages. Weyrother complied and Dohkturov noted them down.  When the read
ing which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again brought his snuffbox 
to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at anyone in particular, began to sa
y how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemy's position was
 assumed to be known, whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in mo
vement. Langeron's objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim 
was to show General Weyrotherwho had read his dispositions with as much selfconfi
dence as if he were addressing school childrenthat he had to do, not with fools, 
but with men who could teach him something in military matters.  When the monoton
ous sound of Weyrother's voice ceased, Kutuzov opened his eye as a miller wakes u
p when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is interrupted. He listened to what 
Langeron said, as if remarking, "So you are still at that silly business!" quickl
y closed his eye again, and let his head sink still lower.  Langeron, trying as v
irulently as possible to sting Weyrother's vanity as author of the military plan,
 argued that Bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked, and so rend
er the whole of this plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with 
a firm and contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objectio
ns be they what they might.  "If he could attack us, he would have done so today,
" said he.  "So you think he is powerless?" said Langeron.  "He has forty thousan
d men at most," replied Weyrother, with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife
 wishes to explain the treatment of a case.  "In that case he is inviting his doo
m by awaiting our attack," said Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again gla
ncing round for support to Miloradovich who was near him.  But Miloradovich was a
t that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals wer
e disputing about.  "Ma foi!" said he, "tomorrow we shall see all that on the bat
tlefield."  Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it wa
s strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to have to 
prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but had also convinced
 the sovereign Emperors of.  "The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual no
ise is heard from his camp," said he. "What does that mean? Either he is retreati
ng, which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position." He smi
led ironically. "But even if he also took up a position in the Thuerassa, he mere
ly saves us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements to the minutest deta
il remain the same."  "How is that?..." began Prince Andrew, who had for long bee
n waiting an opportunity to express his doubts.  Kutuzov here woke up, coughed he
avily, and looked round at the generals.  "Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorr
owor rather for today, for it is past midnightcannot now be altered," said he. "Y
ou have heard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is n
othing more important..." he paused, "than to have a good sleep."  He moved as if
 to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past midnight. Prince Andrew wen
t out.   The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to express 
his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy impression. Whethe
r Dolgorukov and Weyrother, or Kutuzov, Langeron, and the others who did not appr
ove of the plan of attack, were righthe did not know. "But was it really not poss
ible for Kutuzov to state his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that o
n account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives, and my
 life, my life," he thought, "must be risked?"  "Yes, it is very likely that I sh
all be killed tomorrow," he thought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a wh
ole series of most distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination he re
membered his last parting from his father and his wife he remembered the days whe
n he first loved her. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for 
himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in
 which he was billeted with Nesvitski and began to walk up and down before it.  T
he night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed mysteriously. "Yes, 
tomorrow, tomorrow!" he thought. "Tomorrow everything may be over for me! All the
se memories will be no more, none of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow 
perhaps, even certainly, I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall ha
ve to show all I can do." And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the concen
tration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the commanders. And t
hen that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had so long waited, presents itse
lf to him at last. He firmly and clearly expresses his opinion to Kutuzov, to Wey
rother, and to the Emperors. All are struck by the justness of his views, but no 
one undertakes to carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a divisionstipulates th
at no one is to interfere with his arrangementsleads his division to the decisive
 point, and gains the victory alone. "But death and suffering?" suggested another
 voice. Prince Andrew, however, did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of
 his triumphs. The dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone. Nom
inally he is only an adjutant on Kutuzov's staff, but he does everything alone. T
he next battle is won by him alone. Kutuzov is removed and he is appointed... "We
ll and then?" asked the other voice. "If before that you are not ten times wounde
d, killed, or betrayed, well... what then?..." "Well then," Prince Andrew answere
d himself, "I don't know what will happen and don't want to know, and can't, but 
if I want thiswant glory, want to be known to men, want to be loved by them, it i
s not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and live only for that. Y
es, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God! what am I to do if I 
love nothing but fame and men's esteem? Death, wounds, the loss of familyI fear n
othing. And precious and dear as many persons are to mefather, sister, wifethose 
dearest to meyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at onc
e for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men I don't know and n
ever shall know, for the love of these men here," he thought, as he listened to v
oices in Kutuzov's courtyard. The voices were those of the orderlies who were pac
king up one voice, probably a coachman's, was teasing Kutuzov's old cook whom Pri
nce Andrew knew, and who was called Tit. He was saying, "Tit, I say, Tit!"  "Well
?" returned the old man.  "Go, Tit, thresh a bit!" said the wag.  "Oh, go to the 
devil!" called out a voice, drowned by the laughter of the orderlies and servants
.  "All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I value thi
s mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this mist!"      CHAPT
ER XIII   That same night, Rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front
 of Bagration's detachment. His hussars were placed along the line in couples and
 he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that kept coming 
over him. An enormous space, with our army's campfires dimly glowing in the fog, 
could be seen behind him in front of him was misty darkness. Rostov could see not
hing, peer as he would into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray, now t
here was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy oug
ht to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His eyes kept clo
sing, and in his fancy appearednow the Emperor, now Denisov, and now Moscow memor
iesand he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and e
ars of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of t
hem, the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty d
arkness. "Why not?... It might easily happen," thought Rostov, "that the Emperor 
will meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer he'll say 'Go 
and find out what's there.' There are many stories of his getting to know an offi
cer in just such a chance way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a 
place near him? Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I 
would unmask his deceivers!" And in order to realize vividly his love devotion to
 the sovereign, Rostov pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom h
e would not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the
 Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.  
"Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and watchwordshaft, Olmutz. 
What a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow," he thought. "I'll
 ask leave to go to the front, this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. 
It won't be long now before I am off duty. I'll take another turn and when I get 
back I'll go to the general and ask him." He readjusted himself in the saddle and
 touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It seemed to him that 
it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing i
t a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall. On this knoll there was a white p
atch that Rostov could not at all make out was it a glade in the wood lit up by t
he moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something m
oved on that white spot. "I expect it's snow... that spot... a spotune tache," he
 thought. "There now... it's not a tache... Natasha... sister, black eyes... Na..
. tasha... Won't she be surprised when I tell her how I've seen the Emperor? Nata
sha... take my sabretache...""Keep to the right, your honor, there are bushes her
e," came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rostov was riding in the act of fallin
g asleep. Rostov lifted his head that had sunk almost to his horse's mane and pul
led up beside the hussar. He was succumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish d
rowsiness. "But what was I thinking? I mustn't forget. How shall I speak to the E
mperor? No, that's not itthat's tomorrow. Oh yes! Natasha... sabretache... saber 
them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along the Tverskaya 
Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about him too, just opposite G
uryev's house... Old Guryev.... Oh, but Denisov's a fine fellow. But that's all n
onsense. The chief thing is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wis
hed to say something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But that's no
nsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important thing I was thinking of. Y
es, Natasha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! That's right!" And his head once more sank
 to his horse's neck. All at once it seemed to him that he was being fired at. "W
hat? What? What?... Cut them down! What?..." said Rostov, waking up. At the momen
t he opened his eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the longdrawn
 shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar near him pr
icked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the shouting came from, a fir
e flared up and went out again, then another, and all along the French line on th
e hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder. Rostov could hear
 the sound of French words but could not distinguish them. The din of many voices
 was too great all he could hear was "ahahah!" and "rrrr!"  "What's that? What do
 you make of it?" said Rostov to the hussar beside him. "That must be the enemy's
 camp!"  The hussar did not reply.  "Why, don't you hear it?" Rostov asked again,
 after waiting for a reply.  "Who can tell, your honor?" replied the hussar reluc
tantly.  "From the direction, it must be the enemy," repeated Rostov.  "It may be
 he or it may be nothing," muttered the hussar. "It's dark... Steady!" he cried t
o his fidgeting horse.  Rostov's horse was also getting restive it pawed the froz
en ground, pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting
 grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of several th
ousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and farther, probably along t
he line of the French camp. Rostov no longer wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant 
shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him. "Vive l'Empereur! L'E
mpereur!" he now heard distinctly.  "They can't be far off, probably just beyond 
the stream," he said to the hussar beside him.  The hussar only sighed without re
plying and coughed angrily. The sound of horse's hoofs approaching at a trot alon
g the line of hussars was heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a se
rgeant of hussars suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.  "Your honor, t
he generals!" said the sergeant, riding up to Rostov.  Rostov, still looking roun
d toward the fires and the shouts, rode with the sergeant to meet some mounted me
n who were riding along the line. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagration and 
Prince Dolgorukov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon
 of the lights and shouts in the enemy's camp. Rostov rode up to Bagration, repor
ted to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were say
ing.  "Believe me," said Prince Dolgorukov, addressing Bagration, "it is nothing 
but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make 
a noise to deceive us."  "Hardly," said Bagration. "I saw them this evening on th
at knoll if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too.... Office
r!" said Bagration to Rostov, "are the enemy's skirmishers still there?"  "They w
ere there this evening, but now I don't know, your excellency. Shall I go with so
me of my hussars to see?" replied Rostov.  Bagration stopped and, before replying
, tried to see Rostov's face in the mist.  "Well, go and see," he said, after a p
ause.  "Yes, sir."  Rostov spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fedchenko and tw
o other hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction f
rom which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alo
ne with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no 
one had been before him. Bagration called to him from the hill not to go beyond t
he stream, but Rostov pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and 
on, continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and continually di
scovering his mistakes. Having descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw eit
her our own or the enemy's fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudl
y and distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river, but whe
n he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto the road he reined i
n his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the bl
ack field up the hillside. To keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist wo
uld have been safer because it would be easier to see people coming along it. "Fo
llow me!" said he, crossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop tow
ard the point where the French pickets had been standing that evening.  "Your hon
or, there he is!" cried one of the hussars behind him. And before Rostov had time
 to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog, ther
e was a flash, followed by a report, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist wi
th a plaintive sound passed out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashe
d in the pan. Rostov turned his horse and galloped back. Four more reports follow
ed at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different
 tones. Rostov reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen, like his own, at the
 firing, and went back at a footpace. "Well, some more! Some more!" a merry voice
 was saying in his soul. But no more shots came.  Only when approaching Bagration
 did Rostov let his horse gallop again, and with his hand at the salute rode up t
o the general.  Dolgorukov was still insisting that the French had retreated and 
had only lit fires to deceive us.  "What does that prove?" he was saying as Rosto
v rode up. "They might retreat and leave the pickets."  "It's plain that they hav
e not all gone yet, Prince," said Bagration. "Wait till tomorrow morning, we'll f
ind out everything tomorrow."  "The picket is still on the hill, your excellency,
 just where it was in the evening," reported Rostov, stooping forward with his ha
nd at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride a
nd especially by the sound of the bullets.  "Very good, very good," said Bagratio
n. "Thank you, officer."  "Your excellency," said Rostov, "may I ask a favor?"  "
What is it?"  "Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attache
d to the first squadron?"  "What's your name?"  "Count Rostov."  "Oh, very well, 
you may stay in attendance on me."  "Count Ilya Rostov's son?" asked Dolgorukov. 
 But Rostov did not reply.  "Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?"  "I will 
give the order."  "Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the Em
peror," thought Rostov.  "Thank God!"   The fires and shouting in the enemy's arm
y were occasioned by the fact that while Napoleon's proclamation was being read t
o the troops the Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing
 him, lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, "Vive l'Empereur!" Napoleon
's proclamation was as follows   Soldiers! The Russian army is advancing against 
you to avenge the Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at
 Hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position we occupy is 
a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on the right they will e
xpose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct your battalions. I will keep 
out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the
 enemy's ranks, but should victory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see y
our Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be n
o doubt of victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of 
the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.  Do not break your 
ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every man be fully imbued with the
 thought that we must defeat these hirelings of England, inspired by such hatred 
of our nation! This victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winte
r quarters, where fresh French troops who are being raised in France will join us
, and the peace I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myse
lf.  NAPOLEON      CHAPTER XIV   At five in the morning it was still quite dark. 
The troops of the center, the reserves, and Bagration's right flank had not yet m
oved, but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, whic
h were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French right flank an
d drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan, were already up and ast
ir. The smoke of the campfires, into which they were throwing everything superflu
ous, made the eyes smart. It was cold and dark. The officers were hurriedly drink
ing tea and breakfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo wit
h their feet to warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flam
es the remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they d
id not want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides were moving
 in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds of the advance. As soo
n as an Austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer's quarters, the
 regiment began to move the soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into 
their boots, their bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank.
 The officers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches, and m
oved along the ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and pack
ed the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and battalion and regimental c
ommanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave final instructions, orders, and commi
ssions to the baggage men who remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousa
nds of feet resounded. The column moved forward without knowing where and unable,
 from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see either the
 place they were leaving or that to which they were going.  A soldier on the marc
h is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship
. However far he has walked, whatever strange, unknown, and dangerous places he r
eaches, just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and riggi
ng of his ship, so the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same 
ranks, the same sergeant major Ivan Mitrich, the same company dog Jack, and the s
ame commanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is
 sailing, but on the day of battleheaven knows how and whencea stern note of whic
h all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army, announcing the app
roach of something decisive and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curio
sity. On the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests
 of their regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning 
what is going on around them.  The fog had grown so dense that though it was grow
ing light they could not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees a
nd level ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might encounte
r an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced for a long time, alw
ays in the same fog, descending and ascending hills, avoiding gardens and enclosu
res, going over new and unknown ground, and nowhere encountering the enemy. On th
e contrary, the soldiers became aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, ot
her Russian columns were moving in the same direction. Every soldier felt glad to
 know that to the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were goi
ng too.  "There now, the Kurskies have also gone past," was being said in the ran
ks.  "It's wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last night I l
ooked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular Moscow!"  Though n
one of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to the men the comman
ders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of humor and dissatisfied with th
e affair, and so did not exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out
 the orders, yet the troops marched gaily, as they always do when going into acti
on, especially to an attack. But when they had marched for about an hour in the d
ense fog, the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness
 of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks. How such a consciousne
ss is communicated is very difficult to define, but it certainly is communicated 
very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly, and irrepressibly, as water does i
n a creek. Had the Russian army been alone without any allies, it might perhaps h
ave been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general 
conviction, but as it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to t
he stupid Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been oc
casioned by the sausage eaters.  "Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or hav
e we already come up against the French?"  "No, one can't hear them. They'd be fi
ring if we had."  "They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand
 in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It's all those damned Germans'
 muddling! What stupid devils!"  "Yes, I'd send them on in front, but no fear, th
ey're crowding up behind. And now here we stand hungry."  "I say, shall we soon b
e clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the way," said an officer.  "Ah, those
 damned Germans! They don't know their own country!" said another.  "What divisio
n are you?" shouted an adjutant, riding up.  "The Eighteenth."  "Then why are you
 here? You should have gone on long ago, now you won't get there till evening."  
"What stupid orders! They don't themselves know what they are doing!" said the of
ficer and rode off.  Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in 
Russian.  "Tafalafa! But what he's jabbering no one can make out," said a soldier
, mimicking the general who had ridden away. "I'd shoot them, the scoundrels!"  "
We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven't got halfway. Fine 
orders!" was being repeated on different sides.  And the feeling of energy with w
hich the troops had started began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid a
rrangements and at the Germans.  The cause of the confusion was that while the Au
strian cavalry was moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that ou
r center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all orde
red to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the i
nfantry, who had to wait.  At the front an altercation occurred between an Austri
an guide and a Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry sho
uld be halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to bl
ame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After an hour's 
delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog that was dispersing on 
the hill lay still more densely below, where they were descending. In front in th
e fog a shot was heard and then another, at first irregularly at varying interval
strata... tatand then more and more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the 
Goldbach Stream began.  Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, an
d having stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their comma
nders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks, an
d above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog
, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halte
d, receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about i
n the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In th
is way the action began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone 
down into the valley. The fourth column, with which Kutuzov was, stood on the Pra
tzen Heights.  Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog on
 the higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was going o
n in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed, six miles away, or
 whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one knew till after eight o'cl
ock.  It was nine o'clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea down be
low, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood with his m
arshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was a clear blue sky, and the s
un's vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that m
ilky sea of mist. The whole French army, and even Napoleon himself with his staff
, were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappani
tz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action, but wer
e on this side, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could
 distinguish a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he
 had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in f
ront of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of 
the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were moving in the distance, and 
he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley. Not a single muscle of his fac
ewhich in those days was still thinmoved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently o
n one spot. His predictions were being justified. Part of the Russian force had a
lready descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving
 these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the
 position. He saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the villa
ge of Pratzen, the Russian columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving contin
uously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into
 the mist. From information he had received the evening before, from the sound of
 wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night, by the disorderly m
ovement of the Russian columns, and from all indications, he saw clearly that the
 allies believed him to be far away in front of them, and that the columns moving
 near Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army, and that that center wa
s already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still he did not
 begin the engagement.  Today was a great day for himthe anniversary of his coron
ation. Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and in 
good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood
 in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds. He sat motionless, l
ooking at the heights visible above the mist, and his cold face wore that special
 look of confident, selfcomplacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy h
appily in love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his atten
tion. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating up out of the
 mist.  When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were 
aglow with dazzling lightas if he had only awaited this to begin the actionhe dre
w the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign with it to the marshals, and
 ordered the action to begin. The marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped of
f in different directions, and a few minutes later the chief forces of the French
 army moved rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more d
enuded by Russian troops moving down the valley to their left.      CHAPTER XV   
At eight o'clock Kutuzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth column, Milora
dovich's, the one that was to take the place of Przebyszewski's and Langeron's co
lumns which had already gone down into the valley. He greeted the men of the fore
most regiment and gave them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intend
ed to lead that column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he hal
ted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the commander in 
chief's suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation, though 
controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a longawaited moment. He was fir
mly convinced that this was the day of his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola. How i
t would come about he did not know, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality
 and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be known t
o anyone in our army. His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now be ca
rried out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother's plan, Prince Andrew cons
idered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his 
rapidity of perception and decision.  To the left down below in the mist, the mus
ketry fire of unseen forces could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought th
e fight would concentrate. "There we shall encounter difficulties, and there," th
ought he, "I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there, standard in han
d, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me."  He could not look c
almly at the standards of the passing battalions. Seeing them he kept thinking, "
That may be the very standard with which I shall lead the army."  In the morning 
all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning t
o dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a milkwhite sea. Nothing was visible 
in the valley to the left into which our troops had descended and from whence cam
e the sounds of firing. Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the righ
t the vast orb of the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of 
mist, some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably was
, for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were entering the mist
y region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets to
 the left beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared in
 the sea of mist. In front and behind moved infantry. The commander in chief was 
standing at the end of the village letting the troops pass by him. That morning K
utuzov seemed worn and irritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt 
without any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in front.  "D
o order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village!" he said an
grily to a general who had ridden up. "Don't you understand, your excellency, my 
dear sir, that you must not defile through narrow village streets when we are mar
ching against the enemy?"  "I intended to reform them beyond the village, your ex
cellency," answered the general.  Kutuzov laughed bitterly.  "You'll make a fine 
thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy! Very fine!"  "The enemy is still fa
r away, your excellency. According to the dispositions..."  "The dispositions!" e
xclaimed Kutuzov bitterly. "Who told you that?... Kindly do as you are ordered." 
 "Yes, sir."  "My dear fellow," Nesvitski whispered to Prince Andrew, "the old ma
n is as surly as a dog."  An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plume
s in his hat galloped up to Kutuzov and asked in the Emperor's name had the fourt
h column advanced into action.  Kutuzov turned round without answering and his ey
e happened to fall upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutuzov's 
malevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what was being d
one was not his adjutant's fault, and still not answering the Austrian adjutant, 
he addressed Bolkonski.  "Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division 
has passed the village. Tell it to stop and await my orders."  Hardly had Prince 
Andrew started than he stopped him.  "And ask whether sharpshooters have been pos
ted," he added. "What are they doing? What are they doing?" he murmured to himsel
f, still not replying to the Austrian.  Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the
 order.  Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped the thir
d division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front
 of our columns. The colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at th
e commander in chief's order to throw out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure
 that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least
 six miles away. There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren des
cent hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the commander in chief's name t
o rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back. Kutuzov still in the same p
lace, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age, sat
 yawning wearily with closed eyes. The troops were no longer moving, but stood wi
th the butts of their muskets on the ground.  "All right, all right!" he said to 
Prince Andrew, and turned to a general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time
 they started as all the leftflank columns had already descended.  "Plenty of tim
e, your excellency," muttered Kutuzov in the midst of a yawn. "Plenty of time," h
e repeated.  Just then at a distance behind Kutuzov was heard the sound of regime
nts saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line of
 the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were greeting was ridin
g quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which Kutuzov was standi
ng began to shout, he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown. Al
ong the road from Pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen in var
ious uniforms. Two of them rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a b
lack uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the ot
her who was in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors foll
owed by their suites. Kutuzov, affecting the manners of an old soldier at the fro
nt, gave the command "Attention!" and rode up to the Emperors with a salute. His 
whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed. He put on the air of a sub
ordinate who obeys without reasoning. With an affectation of respect which eviden
tly struck Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.  This unpleasant impre
ssion merely flitted over the young and happy face of the Emperor like a cloud of
 haze across a clear sky and vanished. After his illness he looked rather thinner
 that day than on the field of Olmutz where Bolkonski had seen him for the first 
time abroad, but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and m
ildness in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for var
ying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth. 
 At the Olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed brighter and mor
e energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two miles, and reining in hi
s horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite, young and
 animated as his own. Czartoryski, Novosiltsev, Prince Volkonsky, Strogonov, and 
the others, all richly dressed gay young men on splendid, wellgroomed, fresh, onl
y slightly heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the 
Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very erect on his
 handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner. H
e beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question"Most likely he i
s asking at what o'clock they started," thought Prince Andrew, watching his old a
cquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Bru
nn. In the Emperors' suite were the picked young orderly officers of the Guard an
d line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them were grooms leading the Tsar's
 beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths.  As when a window is ope
ned a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room, so a whiff of yout
hfulness, energy, and confidence of success reached Kutuzov's cheerless staff wit
h the galloping advent of all these brilliant young men.  "Why aren't you beginni
ng, Michael Ilarionovich?" said the Emperor Alexander hurriedly to Kutuzov, glanc
ing courteously at the same time at the Emperor Francis.  "I am waiting, Your Maj
esty," answered Kutuzov, bending forward respectfully.  The Emperor, frowning sli
ghtly, bent his ear forward as if he had not quite heard.  "Waiting, Your Majesty
," repeated Kutuzov. Prince Andrew noted that Kutuzov's upper lip twitched unnatu
rally as he said the word "waiting." "Not all the columns have formed up yet, You
r Majesty."  The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged his 
rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosiltsev who was near him, as if complai
ning of Kutuzov.  "You know, Michael Ilarionovich, we are not on the Empress' Fie
ld where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled," said the Tsa
r with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting him if not to join i
n at least to listen to what he was saying. But the Emperor Francis continued to 
look about him and did not listen.  "That is just why I do not begin, sire," said
 Kutuzov in a resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not bei
ng heard, and again something in his face twitched"That is just why I do not begi
n, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Empress' Field," said clearl
y and distinctly.  In the Emperor's suite all exchanged rapid looks that expresse
d dissatisfaction and reproach. "Old though he may be, he should not, he certainl
y should not, speak like that," their glances seemed to say.  The Tsar looked int
ently and observantly into Kutuzov's eye waiting to hear whether he would say any
thing more. But Kutuzov, with respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting.
 The silence lasted for about a minute.  "However, if you command it, Your Majest
y," said Kutuzov, lifting his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, 
unreasoning, but submissive general.  He touched his horse and having called Milo
radovich, the commander of the column, gave him the order to advance.  The troops
 again began to move, and two battalions of the Novgorod and one of the Apsheron 
regiment went forward past the Emperor.  As this Apsheron battalion marched by, t
he redfaced Miloradovich, without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast an
d an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners 
front and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined in
 his horse before the Emperor.  "God be with you, general!" said the Emperor.  "M
a foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite, sire," * he answered
 gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of the Tsar's suit
e by his poor French.        * "Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possib
le to      do, Sire."   Miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed hims
elf a little behind the Emperor. The Apsheron men, excited by the Tsar's presence
, passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk pace.  "La
ds!" shouted Miloradovich in a loud, selfconfident, and cheery voice, obviously s
o elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of battle, and by the sight of t
he gallant Apsherons, his comrades in Suvorov's time, now passing so gallantly be
fore the Emperors, that he forgot the sovereigns' presence. "Lads, it's not the f
irst village you've had to take," cried he.  "Glad to do our best!" shouted the s
oldiers.  The Emperor's horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had carr
ied the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the field of Austerl
itz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the so
und of shots just as it had done on the Empress' Field, not understanding the sig
nificance of the firing, nor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis' black cob, n
or of all that was being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.  The Empe
ror turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a remark to him, pointin
g to the gallant Apsherons.      CHAPTER XVI   Kutuzov accompanied by his adjutan
ts rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers.  When he had gone less than hal
f a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary, deserted house that 
had probably once been an inn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill 
and troops were marching along both.  The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops
 were already dimly visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. 
Down below, on the left, the firing became more distinct. Kutuzov had stopped and
 was speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind look
ing at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.  "Look, look!" s
aid this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the distance, but down the hill b
efore him. "It's the French!"  The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the
 field glass, trying to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their f
aces suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a mile and
 a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us.  "I
t's the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But how is that?" sai
d different voices.  With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right
, not more than five hundred paces from where Kutuzov was standing, a dense Frenc
h column coming up to meet the Apsherons.  "Here it is! The decisive moment has a
rrived. My turn has come," thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode 
up to Kutuzov.  "The Apsherons must be stopped, your excellency," cried he. But a
t that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard quite clo
se at hand, and a voice of naive terror barely two steps from Prince Andrew shout
ed, "Brothers! All's lost!" And at this as if at a command, everyone began to run
.  Confused and everincreasing crowds were running back to where five minutes bef
ore the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it have been difficult to 
stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to be carried back with it oneself. B
olkonski only tried not to lose touch with it, and looked around bewildered and u
nable to grasp what was happening in front of him. Nesvitski with an angry face, 
red and unlike himself, was shouting to Kutuzov that if he did not ride away at o
nce he would certainly be taken prisoner. Kutuzov remained in the same place and 
without answering drew out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing from his cheek. Prin
ce Andrew forced his way to him.  "You are wounded?" he asked, hardly able to mas
ter the trembling of his lower jaw.  "The wound is not here, it is there!" said K
utuzov, pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleein
g soldiers. "Stop them!" he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing t
hat it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.  A f
resh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.  The troops wer
e running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to g
et out again. One was shouting, "Get on! Why are you hindering us?" Another in th
e same place turned round and fired in the air a third was striking the horse Kut
uzov himself rode. Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood 
of men, Kutuzov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a sound
 of artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives, 
Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kutuzov, saw on the slope of the hill amid the
 smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and Frenchmen running toward it. H
igher up stood some Russian infantry, neither moving forward to protect the batte
ry nor backward with the fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself from 
the infantry and approached Kutuzov. Of Kutuzov's suite only four remained. They 
were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.  "Stop those wretches!" gasped Kutu
zov to the regimental commander, pointing to the flying soldiers but at that inst
ant, as if to punish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regimen
t and across Kutuzov's suite like a flock of little birds.  The French had attack
ed the battery and, seeing Kutuzov, were firing at him. After this volley the reg
imental commander clutched at his leg several soldiers fell, and a second lieuten
ant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but 
caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing withou
t orders.  "Oh! Oh! Oh!" groaned Kutuzov despairingly and looked around.... "Bolk
onski!" he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness 
of age, "Bolkonski!" he whispered, pointing to the disordered battalion and at th
e enemy, "what's that?"  But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feel
ing tears of shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and ru
n to the standard.  "Forward, lads!" he shouted in a voice piercing as a child's.
  "Here it is!" thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pl
easure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him. Several soldiers fell.  "Hu
rrah!" shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard, h
e ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him.  An
d really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then another and so
on the whole battalion ran forward shouting "Hurrah!" and overtook him. A sergean
t of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in P
rince Andrew's hands, but he was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized t
he standard and, dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he
 saw our artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned
 their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry soldiers who we
re seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round. Prince Andrew and the
 battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon. He heard the whistle o
f bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually
 groaned and dropped. But he did not look at them he looked only at what was goin
g on in front of himat the battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a redhaired 
gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while a French soldi
er tugged at the other. He could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expressi
on on the faces of these two men, who evidently did not realize what they were do
ing.  "What are they about?" thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them. "Why does
n't the redhaired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why doesn't the Frenchman sta
b him? He will not get away before the Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs 
him...."  And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the s
truggling men, and the fate of the redhaired gunner, who had triumphantly secured
 the mop and still did not realize what awaited him, was about to be decided. But
 Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It seemed to him as though one of the so
ldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a 
little, but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his se
eing what he had been looking at.  "What's this? Am I falling? My legs are giving
 way," thought he, and fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how th
e struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the redhaired gunner 
had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved. But he 
saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the skythe lofty sky, not clear 
yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding slowly across it. "How qui
et, peaceful, and solemn not at all as I ran," thought Prince Andrew"not as we ra
n, shouting and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frighte
ned and angry faces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds glide a
cross that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that lofty sky before? An
d how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, exc
ept that infinite sky. There is nothing, nothing, but that. But even it does not 
exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace. Thank God!..."      CHAPTER XVII   O
n our right flank commanded by Bagration, at nine o'clock the battle had not yet 
begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorukov's demand to commence the action, and wi
shing to avert responsibility from himself, Prince Bagration proposed to Dolgoruk
ov to send to inquire of the commander in chief. Bagration knew that as the dista
nce between the two flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were no
t killed which he very likely would be, and found the commander in chief which wo
uld be very difficult, he would not be able to get back before evening.  Bagratio
n cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite, and the boyish fac
e Rostov, breathless with excitement and hope, was the first to catch his eye. He
 sent him.  "And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in chie
f, your excellency?" said Rostov, with his hand to his cap.  "You can give the me
ssage to His Majesty," said Dolgorukov, hurriedly interrupting Bagration.  On bei
ng relieved from picket duty Rostov had managed to get a few hours' sleep before 
morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, with elasticity of movement, faith
 in his good fortune, and generally in that state of mind which makes everything 
seem possible, pleasant, and easy.  All his wishes were being fulfilled that morn
ing there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part, more than t
hat, he was orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a m
essage to Kutuzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning was bright,
 he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of joy and happiness. On r
eceiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line. At fir
st he rode along the line of Bagration's troops, which had not yet advanced into 
action but were standing motionless then he came to the region occupied by Uvarov
's cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle having 
passed Uvarov's cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead o
f him. The firing grew louder and louder.  In the fresh morning air were now hear
d, not two or three musket shots at irregular intervals as before, followed by on
e or two cannon shots, but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the h
ill before Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes
 several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general ro
ar.  He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another down t
he hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading, and mingling with on
e another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke, mak
e out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons
.  Rostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on, b
ut strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make out anything 
of what was happening there in the smoke men of some sort were moving about, in f
ront and behind moved lines of troops but why, whither, and who they were, it was
 impossible to make out. These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidatin
g effect on him on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.  "
Go on! Go on! Give it them!" he mentally exclaimed at these sounds, and again pro
ceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and farther into the region 
where the army was already in action.  "How it will be there I don't know, but al
l will be well!" thought Rostov.  After passing some Austrian troops he noticed t
hat the next part of the line the Guards was already in action.  "So much the bet
ter! I shall see it close," he thought.  He was riding almost along the front lin
e. A handful of men came galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with diso
rdered ranks were returning from the attack. Rostov got out of their way, involun
tarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.  "That is no busin
ess of mine," he thought. He had not ridden many hundred yards after that before 
he saw to his left, across the whole width of the field, an enormous mass of cava
lry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight towar
d him and across his path. Rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the 
way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the same spee
d, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already g
alloping. Rostov heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons an
d saw their horses, their figures, and even their faces, more and more distinctly
. They were our Horse Guards, advancing to attack the French cavalry that was com
ing to meet them.  The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their ho
rses. Rostov could already see their faces and heard the command "Charge!" shoute
d by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed. Rostov, fearing to
 be crushed or swept into the attack on the French, galloped along the front as h
ard as his horse could go, but still was not in time to avoid them.  The last of 
the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily on seeing Rostov befo
re him, with whom he would inevitably collide. This Guardsman would certainly hav
e bowled Rostov and his Bedouin over Rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak comp
ared to these gigantic men and horses had it not occurred to Rostov to flourish h
is whip before the eyes of the Guardsman's horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen 
hands high, shied, throwing back its ears but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his 
huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and extending its ne
ck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostov before he h
eard them shout, "Hurrah!" and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mi
xed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French. He could see
 nothing more, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and 
smoke enveloped everything.  At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed h
im, disappeared in the smoke, Rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to
 go where he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that ama
zed the French themselves. Rostov was horrified to hear later that of all that ma
ss of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and ca
dets, who had galloped past him on their thousandruble horses, only eighteen were
 left after the charge.  "Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and mayb
e I shall see the Emperor immediately!" thought Rostov and galloped on.  When he 
came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon
 balls were flying, of which he was aware not so much because he heard their soun
d as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers' faces and unnatural warlike solem
nity on those of the officers.  Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of 
Foot Guards he heard a voice calling him by name.  "Rostov!"  "What?" he answered
, not recognizing Boris.  "I say, we've been in the front line! Our regiment atta
cked!" said Boris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have be
en under fire for the first time.  Rostov stopped.  "Have you?" he said. "Well, h
ow did it go?"  "We drove them back!" said Boris with animation, growing talkativ
e. "Can you imagine it?" and he began describing how the Guards, having taken up 
their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were Austrians, and al
l at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they w
ere themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action. Rostov w
ithout hearing Boris to the end spurred his horse.  "Where are you off to?" asked
 Boris.  "With a message to His Majesty."  "There he is!" said Boris, thinking Ro
stov had said "His Highness," and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high sh
oulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and
 Horse Guards' jacket, shouting something to a pale, white uniformed Austrian off
icer.  "But that's the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the Emper
or," said Rostov, and was about to spur his horse.  "Count! Count!" shouted Berg 
who ran up from the other side as eager as Boris. "Count! I am wounded in my righ
t hand" and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it "and I 
remained at the front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our familythe 
von Bergshave been knights!"  He said something more, but Rostov did not wait to 
hear it and rode away.  Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Ro
stov, to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the H
orse Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place whe
re the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he heard musket fir
e quite close in front of him and behind our troops, where he could never have ex
pected the enemy to be.  "What can it be?" he thought. "The enemy in the rear of 
our army? Impossible!" And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself 
and for the issue of the whole battle. "But be that what it may," he reflected, "
there is no riding round it now. I must look for the commander in chief here, and
 if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest."  The foreboding of evil th
at had suddenly come over Rostov was more and more confirmed the farther he rode 
into the region behind the village of Pratzen, which was full of troops of all ki
nds.  "What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is firing?" Ro
stov kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian soldiers running in confus
ed crowds across his path.  "The devil knows! They've killed everybody! It's all 
up now!" he was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who 
understood what was happening as little as he did.  "Kill the Germans!" shouted o
ne.  "May the devil take themthe traitors!"  "Zum Henker diese Russen!" * muttere
d a German.       * "Hang these Russians!"   Several wounded men passed along the
 road, and words of abuse, screams, and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then 
the firing died down. Rostov learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had
 been firing at one another.  "My God! What does it all mean?" thought he. "And h
ere, where at any moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only 
a handful of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it can't be that, it can't be! Onl
y to get past them quicker, quicker!"  The idea of defeat and flight could not en
ter Rostov's head. Though he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen H
eights just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he coul
d not, did not wish to, believe that.      CHAPTER XVIII   Rostov had been ordere
d to look for Kutuzov and the Emperor near the village of Pratzen. But neither th
ey nor a single commanding officer were there, only disorganized crowds of troops
 of various kinds. He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these 
crowds, but the farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on 
which he had come out was thronged with caleches, carriages of all sorts, and Rus
sian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and some not. This whole mas
s droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flyi
ng from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen Heights.  "Where is the Emp
eror? Where is Kutuzov?" Rostov kept asking everyone he could stop, but got no an
swer from anyone.  At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answe
r.  "Eh, brother! They've all bolted long ago!" said the soldier, laughing for so
me reason and shaking himself free.  Having left that soldier who was evidently d
runk, Rostov stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage a
nd began to question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a ca
rriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and that he was da
ngerously wounded.  "It can't be!" said Rostov. "It must have been someone else."
  "I saw him myself," replied the man with a selfconfident smile of derision. "I 
ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I've seen him in Petersburg. I 
saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in the carriage as pale as anything. H
ow they made the four black horses fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! It's t
ime I knew the Imperial horses and Ilya Ivanych. I don't think Ilya drives anyone
 except the Tsar!"  Rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a w
ounded officer passing by addressed him  "Who is it you want?" he asked. "The com
mander in chief? He was killed by a cannon ballstruck in the breast before our re
giment."  "Not killedwounded!" another officer corrected him.  "Who? Kutuzov?" as
ked Rostov.  "Not Kutuzov, but what's his namewell, never mind... there are not m
any left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders are there," said
 the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek, and he walked on.  Rostov ro
de on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going. The Emperor was 
wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to doubt it now. Rostov rode in the d
irection pointed out to him, in which he saw turrets and a church. What need to h
urry? What was he now to say to the Tsar or to Kutuzov, even if they were alive a
nd unwounded?  "Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!"
 a soldier shouted to him. "They'd kill you there!"  "Oh, what are you talking ab
out?" said another. "Where is he to go? That way is nearer."  Rostov considered, 
and then went in the direction where they said he would be killed.  "It's all the
 same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to save myself?" he thought. He
 rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing f
rom Pratzen. The French had not yet occupied that region, and the Russiansthe uni
njured and slightly woundedhad left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps 
of manure on wellkept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each 
couple of acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear
 their distressing screams and groans, sometimes feignedor so it seemed to Rostov
. He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt
 afraidafraid not for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew w
ould not stand the sight of these unfortunates.  The French, who had ceased firin
g at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire 
at, on seeing an adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several s
hots. The sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around 
him merged in Rostov's mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for himself.
 He remembered his mother's last letter. "What would she feel," thought he, "if s
he saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me?"  In the village of
 Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from the field of battle, who thou
gh still in some confusion were less disordered. The French cannon did not reach 
there and the musketry fire sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said 
that the battle was lost. No one whom Rostov asked could tell him where the Emper
or or Kutuzov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was correct,
 others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fac
t that the Emperor's carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with t
he pale and terrified OberHofmarschal Count Tolstoy, who had ridden out to the ba
ttlefield with others in the Emperor's suite. One officer told Rostov that he had
 seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither Rosto
v rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When he had 
ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops, he saw, nea
r a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men on horseback facing the ditch. 
One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rostov the other on a beauti
ful chestnut horse which Rostov fancied he had seen before rode up to the ditch, 
struck his horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only
 a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse's hind hoofs. Turning the 
horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horsema
n with the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do the same. The rid
er, whose figure seemed familiar to Rostov and involuntarily riveted his attentio
n, made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rostov in
stantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch.  "But it can't be he, alone i
n the midst of this empty field!" thought Rostov. At that moment Alexander turned
 his head and Rostov saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his
 memory. The Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the cha
rm, the mildness of his features, was all the greater. Rostov was happy in the as
surance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false. He was happy 
to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even ought to go straight to him and 
give the message Dolgorukov had ordered him to deliver.  But as a youth in love t
rembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nigh
ts, but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longedfor 
moment comes and he is alone with her, so Rostov, now that he had attained what h
e had longed for more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approa
ch the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenie
nt, unseemly, and impossible to do so.  "What! It is as if I were glad of a chanc
e to take advantage of his being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem un
pleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow besides, what can I say to hi
m now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him?" N
ot one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed 
in his imagination could he now recall. Those speeches were intended for quite ot
her conditions, they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory a
nd triumph, generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked h
im for heroic deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved
.  "Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right flank no
w that it is nearly four o'clock and the battle is lost? No, certainly I must not
 approach him, I must not intrude on his reflections. Better die a thousand times
 than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him," Rostov decided and 
sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back 
at the Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.  While Rostov
 was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away, Captain von Toll chanced to
 ride to the same spot, and seeing the Emperor at once rode up to him, offered hi
s services, and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to 
rest and feeling unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained besid
e him. Rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long a
nd warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping, covered his eyes
 with his hand and pressed von Toll's hand.  "And I might have been in his place!
" thought Rostov, and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he ro
de on in utter despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.  His despa
ir was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the cause of his gr
ief.  He might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign. It wa
s a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not made use of 
it.... "What have I done?" thought he. And he turned round and galloped back to t
he place where he had seen the Emperor, but there was no one beyond the ditch now
. Only some carts and carriages were passing by. From one of the drivers he learn
ed that Kutuzov's staff were not far off, in the village the vehicles were going 
to. Rostov followed them. In front of him walked Kutuzov's groom leading horses i
n horsecloths. Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old, bandylegged domes
tic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.  "Tit! I say, Tit!" said the groom. 
 "What?" answered the old man absentmindedly.  "Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!"  "Oh, you
 fool!" said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed in silence, and then
 the same joke was repeated.   Before five in the evening the battle had been los
t at all points. More than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the Fren
ch.  Przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other columns after lo
sing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses.  The remains o
f Langeron's and Dokhturov's mingled forces were crowding around the dams and ban
ks of the ponds near the village of Augesd.  After five o'clock it was only at th
e Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade delivered by the French alone was still to be h
eard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directe
d at our retreating forces.  In the rearguard, Dokhturov and others rallying some
 battalions kept up a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our t
roops. It was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the 
old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling, whi
le his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the floundering silvery fi
sh in the watering can, on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in sha
ggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their twohorse carts loaded with 
wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their cartson that narrow dam a
mid the wagons and the cannon, under the horses' hoofs and between the wagon whee
ls, men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one another, d
ying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to move on a few step
s and be killed themselves in the same way.  Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew
 compressing the air around, or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, 
killing some and splashing with blood those near them.  Dolokhovnow an officerwou
nded in the arm, and on foot, with the regimental commander on horseback and some
 ten men of his company, represented all that was left of that whole regiment. Im
pelled by the crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jamme
d in on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon
 and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon ball killed someone behind them, an
other fell in front and splashed Dolokhov with blood. The crowd, pushing forward 
desperately, squeezed together, moved a few steps, and again stopped.  "Move on a
 hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here another two minutes and it
 is certain death," thought each one.  Dolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd
 forced his way to the edge of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and
 ran onto the slippery ice that covered the millpool.  "Turn this way!" he shoute
d, jumping over the ice which creaked under him "turn this way!" he shouted to th
ose with the gun. "It bears!..."  The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and
 it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very
 soon even under his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the bank,
 hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the entrance to the
 dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address Dolokhov. Suddenly a cannon 
ball hissed so low above the crowd that everyone ducked. It flopped into somethin
g moist, and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him 
a look or thought of raising him.  "Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! 
Don't you hear? Go on!" innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had st
ruck the general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were shouting
.  One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice. 
Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond. The ice gave 
way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped into the water. He tr
ied to right himself but fell in up to his waist. The nearest soldiers shrank bac
k, the gun driver stopped his horse, but from behind still came the shouts "Onto 
the ice, why do you stop? Go on! Go on!" And cries of horror were heard in the cr
owd. The soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them 
turn and move on. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that had held under tho
se on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on it dashed, 
some forward and some back, drowning one another.  Still the cannon balls continu
ed regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of 
all among the crowd that covered the dam, the pond, and the bank.      CHAPTER XI
X   On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand, l
ay Prince Andrew Bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle
, piteous, and childlike moan.  Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite
 still. He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again fe
lt that he was alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.  
"Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw today?" was hi
s first thought. "And I did not know this suffering either," he thought. "Yes, I 
did not know anything, anything at all till now. But where am I?"  He listened an
d heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices speaking French. He opened hi
s eyes. Above him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and wer
e floating still higher, and between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn 
his head and did not see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had
 ridden up and stopped near him.  It was Napoleon accompanied by two aidesdecamp.
 Bonaparte riding over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the b
atteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left 
on the field.  "Fine men!" remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier
, who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his stomac
h with an already stiffened arm flung wide.  "The ammunition for the guns in posi
tion is exhausted, Your Majesty," said an adjutant who had come from the batterie
s that were firing at Augesd.  "Have some brought from the reserve," said Napoleo
n, and having gone on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his
 back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. The flag had already b
een taken by the French as a trophy.  "That's a fine death!" said Napoleon as he 
gazed at Bolkonski.  Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that 
it was Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he heard
 the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only did they not int
erest him, but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them. His head was bu
rning, he felt himself bleeding to death, and he saw above him the remote, lofty,
 and everlasting sky. He knew it was Napoleonhis herobut at that moment Napoleon 
seemed to him such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing
 now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it. 
At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him, or what wa
s said of him he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished
 that they would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed to him so beau
tiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently. He collected
 all his strength, to stir and utter a sound. He feebly moved his leg and uttered
 a weak, sickly groan which aroused his own pity.  "Ah! He is alive," said Napole
on. "Lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station."  Having said 
this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in hand, rode up smiling 
to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.  Prince Andrew remembered noth
ing more he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the st
retcher, the jolting while being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dress
ing station. He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with othe
r wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital. During th
is transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even spe
ak.  The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French conv
oy officer, who said rapidly "We must halt here the Emperor will pass here immedi
ately it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners."  "There are so many p
risoners today, nearly the whole Russian army, that he is probably tired of them,
" said another officer.  "All the same! They say this one is the commander of all
 the Emperor Alexander's Guards," said the first one, indicating a Russian office
r in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.  Bolkonski recognized Prince Repnin w
hom he had met in Petersburg society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a 
wounded officer of the Horse Guards.  Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stop
ped his horse.  "Which is the senior?" he asked, on seeing the prisoners.  They n
amed the colonel, Prince Repnin.  "You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander
's regiment of Horse Guards?" asked Napoleon.  "I commanded a squadron," replied 
Repnin.  "Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably," said Napoleon.  "The prais
e of a great commander is a soldier's highest reward," said Repnin.  "I bestow it
 with pleasure," said Napoleon. "And who is that young man beside you?"  Prince R
epnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen.  After looking at him Napoleon smiled.  "He's v
ery young to come to meddle with us."  "Youth is no hindrance to courage," mutter
ed Sukhtelen in a failing voice.  "A splendid reply!" said Napoleon. "Young man, 
you will go far!"  Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Em
peror's eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his att
ention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and, address
ing him, again used the epithet "young man" that was connected in his memory with
 Prince Andrew.  "Well, and you, young man," said he. "How do you feel, mon brave
?"  Though five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few words to
 the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed straight on Napoleon
, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interes
ts that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity a
nd joy in victory appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which 
he had seen and understood, that he could not answer him.  Everything seemed so f
utile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought 
that weakness from loss of blood, suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in
 him. Looking into Napoleon's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of
 greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and the still
 greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one alive could understan
d or explain.  The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to 
one of the officers as he went "Have these gentlemen attended to and taken to my 
bivouac let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds. Au revoir, Prince Repnin!" a
nd he spurred his horse and galloped away.  His face shone with selfsatisfaction 
and pleasure.  The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken t
he little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother's neck, but seeing t
he favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to return the holy i
mage.  Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the little 
icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his unifor
m.  "It would be good," thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his sister ha
d hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, "it would be good if every
thing were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary. How good it would be to know 
where to seek for help in this life, and what to expect after it beyond the grave
! How happy and calm I should be if I could now say 'Lord, have mercy on me!'... 
But to whom should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible, w
hich I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in wordsthe Great 
All or Nothing" said he to himself, "or to that God who has been sewn into this a
mulet by Mary! There is nothing certain, nothing at all except the unimportance o
f everything I understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but al
limportant."  The stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pa
in his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his father, wife,
 sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night before the batt
le, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and above all this the lofty
 sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies.  The quiet home life an
d peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented itself to him. He was already enjoyi
ng that happiness when that little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsymp
athizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and tor
ments had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward morning all these
 dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and obliv
ion which in the opinion of Napoleon's doctor, Larrey, was much more likely to en
d in death than in convalescence.  "He is a nervous, bilious subject," said Larre
y, "and will not recover."  And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was l
eft to the care of the inhabitants of the district.      BOOK FOUR 1806      CHAP
TER I   Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostov returned home on leave. Denisov wa
s going home to Voronezh and Rostov persuaded him to travel with him as far as Mo
scow and to stay with him there. Meeting a comrade at the last post station but o
ne before Moscow, Denisov had drunk three bottles of wine with him and, despite t
he jolting ruts across the snowcovered road, did not once wake up on the way to M
oscow, but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside Rostov, who grew more and more 
impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.  "How much longer? How much longer? Oh, 
these insufferable streets, shops, bakers' signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!
" thought Rostov, when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and t
hey had entered Moscow.  "Denisov! We're here! He's asleep," he added, leaning fo
rward with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of 
the sleigh.  Denisov gave no answer.  "There's the corner at the crossroads, wher
e the cabman, Zakhar, has his stand, and there's Zakhar himself and still the sam
e horse! And here's the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Can't you h
urry up? Now then!"  "Which house is it?" asked the driver.  "Why, that one, righ
t at the end, the big one. Don't you see? That's our house," said Rostov. "Of cou
rse, it's our house! Denisov, Denisov! We're almost there!"  Denisov raised his h
ead, coughed, and made no answer.  "Dmitri," said Rostov to his valet on the box,
 "those lights are in our house, aren't they?"  "Yes, sir, and there's a light in
 your father's study."  "Then they've not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Min
d now, don't forget to put out my new coat," added Rostov, fingering his new must
ache. "Now then, get on," he shouted to the driver. "Do wake up, Vaska!" he went 
on, turning to Denisov, whose head was again nodding. "Come, get on! You shall ha
ve three rubles for vodkaget on!" Rostov shouted, when the sleigh was only three 
houses from his door. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at all. At last
 the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and Rostov saw overhead th
e old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off, the porch, and the post 
by the side of the pavement. He sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran int
o the hall. The house stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had co
me to it. There was no one in the hall. "Oh God! Is everyone all right?" he thoug
ht, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then immediately starting to 
run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase. The wellkno
wn old door handle, which always angered the countess when it was not properly cl
eaned, turned as loosely as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom
.  Old Michael was asleep on the chest. Prokofy, the footman, who was so strong t
hat he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat plaiting slippers out
 of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleep
y indifference suddenly changed to one of delighted amazement.  "Gracious heavens
! The young count!" he cried, recognizing his young master. "Can it be? My treasu
re!" and Prokofy, trembling with excitement, rushed toward the drawingroom door, 
probably in order to announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped 
to kiss the young man's shoulder.  "All well?" asked Rostov, drawing away his arm
.  "Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They've just finished supper. Let me have a look at
 you, your excellency."  "Is everything quite all right?"  "The Lord be thanked, 
yes!"  Rostov, who had completely forgotten Denisov, not wishing anyone to forest
all him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the large dark ballroom
. All was the same there were the same old card tables and the same chandelier wi
th a cover over it but someone had already seen the young master, and, before he 
had reached the drawing room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado 
and began hugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the same k
ind sprang from a second door and a third more hugging, more kissing, more outcri
es, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was Papa, which Natasha, and
 which Petya. Everyone shouted, talked, and kissed him at the same time. Only his
 mother was not there, he noticed that.  "And I did not know... Nicholas... My da
rling!..."  "Here he is... our own... Kolya, * dear fellow... How he has changed!
... Where are the candles?... Tea!..."       * Nicholas.   "And me, kiss me!"  "D
earest... and me!"  Sonya, Natasha, Petya, Anna Mikhaylovna, Vera, and the old co
unt were all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the room, ex
claiming and ohing and ahing.  Petya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, "And m
e too!"  Natasha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face w
ith kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang away and pranced u
p and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly.  All around were lov
ing eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around were lips seeking a kiss.  
Sonya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss, looked eagerly
 toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she longed. Sonya now was sixtee
n and she was very pretty, especially at this moment of happy, rapturous exciteme
nt. She gazed at him, not taking her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her br
eath. He gave her a grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for someon
e. The old countess had not yet come. But now steps were heard at the door, steps
 so rapid that they could hardly be his mother's.  Yet it was she, dressed in a n
ew gown which he did not know, made since he had left. All the others let him go,
 and he ran to her. When they met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not
 lift her face, but only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar's jacket. 
Denisov, who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped hi
s eyes at the sight.  "Vasili Denisov, your son's friend," he said, introducing h
imself to the count, who was looking inquiringly at him.  "You are most welcome! 
I know, I know," said the count, kissing and embracing Denisov. "Nicholas wrote u
s... Natasha, Vera, look! Here is Denisov!"  The same happy, rapturous faces turn
ed to the shaggy figure of Denisov.  "Darling Denisov!" screamed Natasha, beside 
herself with rapture, springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing h
im. This escapade made everybody feel confused. Denisov blushed too, but smiled a
nd, taking Natasha's hand, kissed it.  Denisov was shown to the room prepared for
 him, and the Rostovs all gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.  The old c
ountess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every moment, sat beside him t
he rest, crowding round him, watched every movement, word, or look of his, never 
taking their blissfully adoring eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled f
or the places nearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring him h
is tea, handkerchief, and pipe.  Rostov was very happy in the love they showed hi
m but the first moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seeme
d insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.  Next mo
rning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept till ten o'clock.
  In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers, satchels, sabre
taches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly cleaned pairs with spurs 
had just been placed by the wall. The servants were bringing in jugs and basins, 
hot water for shaving, and their wellbrushed clothes. There was a masculine odor 
and a smell of tobacco.  "Hallo, Gwiskamy pipe!" came Vasili Denisov's husky voic
e. "Wostov, get up!"  Rostov, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised
 his disheveled head from the hot pillow.  "Why, is it late?"  "Late! It's nearly
 ten o'clock," answered Natasha's voice. A rustle of starched petticoats and the 
whispering and laughter of girls' voices came from the adjoining room. The door w
as opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black ha
ir, and merry faces. It was Natasha, Sonya, and Petya, who had come to see whethe
r they were getting up.  "Nicholas! Get up!" Natasha's voice was again heard at t
he door.  "Directly!"  Meanwhile, Petya, having found and seized the sabers in th
e outer room, with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother
, and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed, opene
d the bedroom door.  "Is this your saber?" he shouted.  The girls sprang aside. D
enisov hid his hairy legs under the blanket, looking with a scared face at his co
mrade for help. The door, having let Petya in, closed again. A sound of laughter 
came from behind it.  "Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!" said Natasha's 
voice.  "Is this your saber?" asked Petya. "Or is it yours?" he said, addressing 
the blackmustached Denisov with servile deference.  Rostov hurriedly put somethin
g on his feet, drew on his dressing gown, and went out. Natasha had put on one sp
urred boot and was just getting her foot into the other. Sonya, when he came in, 
was twirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit dow
n. They were dressed alike, in new paleblue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, an
d bright. Sonya ran away, but Natasha, taking her brother's arm, led him into the
 sitting room, where they began talking. They hardly gave one another time to ask
 questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not 
interest anyone but themselves. Natasha laughed at every word he said or that she
 said herself, not because what they were saying was amusing, but because she fel
t happy and was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.  "O
h, how nice, how splendid!" she said to everything.  Rostov felt that, under the 
influence of the warm rays of love, that childlike smile which had not once appea
red on his face since he left home now for the first time after eighteen months a
gain brightened his soul and his face.  "No, but listen," she said, "now you are 
quite a man, aren't you? I'm awfully glad you're my brother." She touched his mus
tache. "I want to know what you men are like. Are you the same as we? No?"  "Why 
did Sonya run away?" asked Rostov.  "Ah, yes! That's a whole long story! How are 
you going to speak to herthou or you?"  "As may happen," said Rostov.  "No, call 
her you, please! I'll tell you all about it some other time. No, I'll tell you no
w. You know Sonya's my dearest friend. Such a friend that I burned my arm for her
 sake. Look here!"  She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on 
her long, slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covere
d even by a ball dress.  "I burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a
 ruler in the fire and pressed it there!"  Sitting on the sofa with the little cu
shions on its arms, in what used to be his old schoolroom, and looking into Natas
ha's wildly bright eyes, Rostov reentered that world of home and childhood which 
had no meaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life an
d the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him sense
less, he understood and was not surprised at it.  "Well, and is that all?" he ask
ed.  "We are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just nonsens
e, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does it for life, but I 
don't understand that, I forget quickly."  "Well, what then?"  "Well, she loves m
e and you like that."  Natasha suddenly flushed.  "Why, you remember before you w
ent away?... Well, she says you are to forget all that.... She says 'I shall love
 him always, but let him be free.' Isn't that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? 
Isn't it?" asked Natasha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that wha
t she was now saying she had talked of before, with tears.  Rostov became thought
ful.  "I never go back on my word," he said. "Besides, Sonya is so charming that 
only a fool would renounce such happiness."  "No, no!" cried Natasha, "she and I 
have already talked it over. We knew you'd say so. But it won't do, because you s
ee, if you say thatif you consider yourself bound by your promiseit will seem as 
if she had not meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying her becaus
e you must, and that wouldn't do at all."  Rostov saw that it had been well consi
dered by them. Sonya had already struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. T
oday, when he had caught a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was 
a charming girl of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him he did not do
ubt that for an instant. Why should he not love her now, and even marry her, Rost
ov thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures and interests before 
him! "Yes, they have taken a wise decision," he thought, "I must remain free."  "
Well then, that's excellent," said he. "We'll talk it over later on. Oh, how glad
 I am to have you!"  "Well, and are you still true to Boris?" he continued.  "Oh,
 what nonsense!" cried Natasha, laughing. "I don't think about him or anyone else
, and I don't want anything of the kind."  "Dear me! Then what are you up to now?
"  "Now?" repeated Natasha, and a happy smile lit up her face. "Have you seen Dup
ort?"  "No."  "Not seen Duportthe famous dancer? Well then, you won't understand.
 That's what I'm up to."  Curving her arms, Natasha held out her skirts as dancer
s do, ran back a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply 
together, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.  "See, I'm standing! 
See!" she said, but could not maintain herself on her toes any longer. "So that's
 what I'm up to! I'll never marry anyone, but will be a dancer. Only don't tell a
nyone."  Rostov laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov, in his bedroom, felt en
vious and Natasha could not help joining in.  "No, but don't you think it's nice?
" she kept repeating.  "Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry Boris?"  Natasha
 flared up. "I don't want to marry anyone. And I'll tell him so when I see him!" 
 "Dear me!" said Rostov.  "But that's all rubbish," Natasha chattered on. "And is
 Denisov nice?" she asked.  "Yes, indeed!"  "Oh, well then, goodby go and dress. 
Is he very terrible, Denisov?"  "Why terrible?" asked Nicholas. "No, Vaska is a s
plendid fellow."  "You call him Vaska? That's funny! And is he very nice?"  "Very
."  "Well then, be quick. We'll all have breakfast together."  And Natasha rose a
nd went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet dancer, but smiling as only happ
y girls of fifteen can smile. When Rostov met Sonya in the drawing room, he redde
ned. He did not know how to behave with her. The evening before, in the first hap
py moment of meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could no
t be done he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was looking i
nquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her. He kissed her
 hand and addressed her not as thou but as youSonya. But their eyes met and said 
thou, and exchanged tender kisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for having 
dared, by Natasha's intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and then thanked 
him for his love. His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her
 that one way or another he would never cease to love her, for that would be impo
ssible.  "How strange it is," said Vera, selecting a moment when all were silent,
 "that Sonya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet like strangers."  V
era's remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like most of her obser
vations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not only Sonya, Nicholas, and Natas
ha, but even the old countess, whodreading this love affair which might hinder Ni
cholas from making a brilliant matchblushed like a girl.  Denisov, to Rostov's su
rprise, appeared in the drawing room with pomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new un
iform, looking just as smart as he made himself when going into battle, and he wa
s more amiable to the ladies and gentlemen than Rostov had ever expected to see h
im.      CHAPTER II   On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rostov was 
welcomed by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling Nikole
nka by his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young man by his acqua
intances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good dancer, and one of the best 
matches in the city.  The Rostovs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had mon
ey enough that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas, ac
quiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the latest cut, suc
h as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the latest fashion, with extreme
ly pointed toes and small silver spurs, passed his time very gaily. After a short
 period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very
 pleasant to be at home again. He felt that he had grown up and matured very much
. His despair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money from Gav
ril to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing Sonya on the slyhe now recalled all this 
as childishness he had left immeasurably behind. Now he was a lieutenant of hussa
rs, in a jacket laced with silver, and wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded t
o soldiers for bravery in action, and in the company of wellknown, elderly, and r
espected racing men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a lady 
on one of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the mazurka at the
 Arkharovs' ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal Kamenski, visited the E
nglish Club, and was on intimate terms with a colonel of forty to whom Denisov ha
d introduced him.  His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But
 still, as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spok
e about him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he had not 
told all and that there was something in his feelings for the Emperor not everyon
e could understand, and with his whole soul he shared the adoration then common i
n Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of as the "angel incarnate."  During Ros
tov's short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he did not draw closer to 
Sonya, but rather drifted away from her. She was very pretty and sweet, and evide
ntly deeply in love with him, but he was at the period of youth when there seems 
so much to do that there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears 
to bind himself and prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things. W
hen he thought of Sonya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself, "Ah, the
re will be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom I do not yet know.
 There will be time enough to think about love when I want to, but now I have no 
time." Besides, it seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory 
to his manhood. He went to balls and into ladies' society with an affectation of 
doing so against his will. The races, the English Club, sprees with Denisov, and 
visits to a certain housethat was another matter and quite the thing for a dashin
g young hussar!  At the beginning of March, old Count Ilya Rostov was very busy a
rranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagration at the English Club.  The count wa
lked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving orders to the club steward
 and to the famous Feoktist, the Club's head cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbe
rs, strawberries, veal, and fish for this dinner. The count had been a member and
 on the committee of the Club from the day it was founded. To him the Club entrus
ted the arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagration, for few men knew so we
ll how to arrange a feast on an openhanded, hospitable scale, and still fewer men
 would be so well able and willing to make up out of their own resources what mig
ht be needed for the success of the fete. The club cook and the steward listened 
to the count's orders with pleased faces, for they knew that under no other manag
ement could they so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner cos
ting several thousand rubles.  "Well then, mind and have cocks' comb in the turtl
e soup, you know!"  "Shall we have three cold dishes then?" asked the cook.  The 
count considered.  "We can't have lessyes, three... the mayonnaise, that's one," 
said he, bending down a finger.  "Then am I to order those large sterlets?" asked
 the steward.  "Yes, it can't be helped if they won't take less. Ah, dear me! I w
as forgetting. We must have another entree. Ah, goodness gracious!" he clutched a
t his head. "Who is going to get me the flowers? Dmitri! Eh, Dmitri! Gallop off t
o our Moscow estate," he said to the factotum who appeared at his call. "Hurry of
f and tell Maksim, the gardener, to set the serfs to work. Say that everything ou
t of the hothouses must be brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two 
hundred pots here on Friday."  Having given several more orders, he was about to 
go to his "little countess" to have a rest, but remembering something else of imp
ortance, he returned again, called back the cook and the club steward, and again 
began giving orders. A light footstep and the clinking of spurs were heard at the
 door, and the young count, handsome, rosy, with a dark little mustache, evidentl
y rested and made sleeker by his easy life in Moscow, entered the room.  "Ah, my 
boy, my head's in a whirl!" said the old man with a smile, as if he felt a little
 confused before his son. "Now, if you would only help a bit! I must have singers
 too. I shall have my own orchestra, but shouldn't we get the gypsy singers as we
ll? You military men like that sort of thing."  "Really, Papa, I believe Prince B
agration worried himself less before the battle of Schon Grabern than you do now,
" said his son with a smile.  The old count pretended to be angry.  "Yes, you tal
k, but try it yourself!"  And the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd an
d respectful expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and
 son.  "What have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feoktist?" said he. "Lau
ghing at us old fellows!"  "That's so, your excellency, all they have to do is to
 eat a good dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, that's not their busi
ness!"  "That's it, that's it!" exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing his son by
 both hands, he cried, "Now I've got you, so take the sleigh and pair at once, an
d go to Bezukhov's, and tell him 'Count Ilya has sent you to ask for strawberries
 and fresh pineapples.' We can't get them from anyone else. He's not there himsel
f, so you'll have to go in and ask the princesses and from there go on to the Ras
gulyaythe coachman Ipatka knowsand look up the gypsy Ilyushka, the one who danced
 at Count Orlov's, you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and bring him along to 
me."  "And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?" asked Nicholas, laughin
g. "Dear, dear!..."  At that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the busine
sslike, preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna Mi
khaylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count in his dressing gown e
very day, he invariably became confused and begged her to excuse his costume.  "N
o matter at all, my dear count," she said, meekly closing her eyes. "But I'll go 
to Bezukhov's myself. Pierre has arrived, and now we shall get anything we want f
rom his hothouses. I have to see him in any case. He has forwarded me a letter fr
om Boris. Thank God, Boris is now on the staff."  The count was delighted at Anna
 Mikhaylovna's taking upon herself one of his commissions and ordered the small c
losed carriage for her.  "Tell Bezukhov to come. I'll put his name down. Is his w
ife with him?" he asked.  Anna Mikhaylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadne
ss was depicted on her face.  "Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate," she s
aid. "If what we hear is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a th
ing when we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul as you
ng Bezukhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give him what consol
ation I can."  "Whwhat is the matter?" asked both the young and old Rostov.  Anna
 Mikhaylovna sighed deeply.  "Dolokhov, Mary Ivanovna's son," she said in a myste
rious whisper, "has compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him up, inv
ited him to his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here and that darede
vil after her!" said Anna Mikhaylovna, wishing to show her sympathy for Pierre, b
ut by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her sympathy for the "da
redevil," as she called Dolokhov. "They say Pierre is quite broken by his misfort
une."  "Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the Clubit will all blow over. 
It will be a tremendous banquet."  Next day, the third of March, soon after one o
'clock, two hundred and fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were a
waiting the guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince Bagration, t
o dinner.  On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow h
ad been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to victories that on 
receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it, while others sough
t some extraordinary explanation of so strange an event. In the English Club, whe
re all who were distinguished, important, and well informed foregathered when the
 news began to arrive in December, nothing was said about the war and the last ba
ttle, as though all were in a conspiracy of silence. The men who set the tone in 
conversationCount Rostopchin, Prince Yuri Dolgorukov, Valuev, Count Markov, and P
rince Vyazemskidid not show themselves at the Club, but met in private houses in 
intimate circles, and the Moscovites who took their opinions from othersIlya Rost
ov among themremained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject of 
the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and tha
t to discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best to be silent. But aft
er a while, just as a jury comes out of its room, the bigwigs who guided the Club
's opinion reappeared, and everybody began speaking clearly and definitely. Reaso
ns were found for the incredible, unheardof, and impossible event of a Russian de
feat, everything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things began
 to be said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a defective commi
ssariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebyszewski and of the Frenchman Langeron, K
utuzov's incapacity, and it was whispered the youth and inexperience of the sover
eign, who had trusted worthless and insignificant people. But the army, the Russi
an army, everyone declared, was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor.
 The soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was Pri
nce Bagration, distinguished by his Schon Grabern affair and by the retreat from 
Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beat
en back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own. What also conduced to Bagrat
ion's being selected as Moscow's hero was the fact that he had no connections in 
the city and was a stranger there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple fig
hting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one who was assoc
iated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suvorov. Moreover, pay
ing such honor to Bagration was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislik
e of Kutuzov.  "Had there been no Bagration, it would have been necessary to inve
nt him," said the wit Shinshin, parodying the words of Voltaire. Kutuzov no one s
poke of, except some who abused him in whispers, calling him a court weathercock 
and an old satyr.  All Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorukov's saying "If you go on m
odeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay," suggesting consolation for 
our defeat by the memory of former victories and the words of Rostopchin, that Fr
ench soldiers have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words, and Germans by l
ogical arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advan
ce, but that Russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all si
des, new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown b
y our officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another had kille
d five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded. Berg was mentioned
, by those who did not know him, as having, when wounded in the right hand, taken
 his sword in the left, and gone forward. Of Bolkonski, nothing was said, and onl
y those who knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young, leaving a pr
egnant wife with his eccentric father.      CHAPTER III   On that third of March,
 all the rooms in the English Club were filled with a hum of conversation, like t
he hum of bees swarming in springtime. The members and guests of the Club wandere
d hither and thither, sat, stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in
 evening dress, and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftan
s. Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings, stood at e
very door anxiously noting visitors' every movement in order to offer their servi
ces. Most of those present were elderly, respected men with broad, selfconfident 
faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures and voices. This class of guests and me
mbers sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups. A minori
ty of those present were casual guestschiefly young men, among whom were Denisov,
 Rostov, and Dolokhovwho was now again an officer in the Semenov regiment. The fa
ces of these young people, especially those who were military men, bore that expr
ession of condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older 
generation, "We are prepared to respect and honor you, but all the same remember 
that the future belongs to us."  Nesvitski was there as an old member of the Club
. Pierre, who at his wife's command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spect
acles, went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull. Here, a
s elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his wealth, an
d being in the habit of lording it over these people, he treated them with absent
minded contempt.  By his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by h
is wealth and connections he belonged to the groups old and honored guests, and s
o he went from one group to another. Some of the most important old men were the 
center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully to hear the voices 
of wellknown men. The largest circles formed round Count Rostopchin, Valuev, and 
Naryshkin. Rostopchin was describing how the Russians had been overwhelmed by fly
ing Austrians and had had to force their way through them with bayonets.  Valuev 
was confidentially telling that Uvarov had been sent from Petersburg to ascertain
 what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.  In the third circle, Naryshkin was s
peaking of the meeting of the Austrian Council of War at which Suvorov crowed lik
e a cock in reply to the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. Shinshin, stan
ding close by, tried to make a joke, saying that Kutuzov had evidently failed to 
learn from Suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a cock, but 
the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him feel that in that place
 and on that day, it was improper to speak so of Kutuzov.  Count Ilya Rostov, hur
ried and preoccupied, went about in his soft boots between the dining and drawing
 rooms, hastily greeting the important and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as i
f they were all equals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine wellsetup
 young son, resting on him and winking joyfully at him. Young Rostov stood at a w
indow with Dolokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued. The
 old count came up to them and pressed Dolokhov's hand.  "Please come and visit u
s... you know my brave boy... been together out there... both playing the hero...
 Ah, Vasili Ignatovich... How d'ye do, old fellow?" he said, turning to an old ma
n who was passing, but before he had finished his greeting there was a general st
ir, and a footman who had run in announced, with a frightened face "He's arrived!
"  Bells rang, the stewards rushed forward, andlike rye shaken together in a shov
elthe guests who had been scattered about in different rooms came together and cr
owded in the large drawing room by the door of the ballroom.  Bagration appeared 
in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword, which, in accord with the Cl
ub custom, he had given up to the hall porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head
, nor had he a loaded whip over his shoulder, as when Rostov had seen him on the 
eve of the battle of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and fo
reign Orders, and the Star of St. George on his left breast. Evidently just befor
e coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed, which changed hi
s appearance for the worse. There was something naively festive in his air, which
, in conjunction with his firm and virile features, gave him a rather comical exp
ression. Bekleshev and Theodore Uvarov, who had arrived with him, paused at the d
oorway to allow him, as the guest of honor, to enter first. Bagration was embarra
ssed, not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay 
at the doors, but after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly and awkwa
rdly over the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing what to do with hi
s hands he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire, as he had 
done at the head of the Kursk regiment at Schon Grabernand he would have found th
at easier. The committeemen met him at the first door and, expressing their delig
ht at seeing such a highly honored guest, took possession of him as it were, with
out waiting for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It wa
s at first impossible to enter the drawingroom door for the crowd of members and 
guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at Bagration over each 
other's shoulders, as if he were some rare animal. Count Ilya Rostov, laughing an
d repeating the words, "Make way, dear boy! Make way, make way!" pushed through t
he crowd more energetically than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, an
d seated them on the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members of the 
Club, beset the new arrivals. Count Ilya, again thrusting his way through the cro
wd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with another commi
tteeman, carrying a large silver salver which he presented to Prince Bagration. O
n the salver lay some verses composed and printed in the hero's honor. Bagration,
 on seeing the salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help. But all 
eyes demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in their power, he resolutel
y took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the cou
nt who had presented it to him. Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagration o
r he would, it seemed, have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with 
it and drew his attention to the verses.  "Well, I will read them, then!" Bagrati
on seemed to say, and, fixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them wit
h a fixed and serious expression. But the author himself took the verses and bega
n reading them aloud. Bagration bowed his head and listened     Bring glory then 
to Alexander's reign    And on the throne our Titus shield.    A dreaded foe be t
hou, kindhearted as a man,    A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!    E'en 
fortunate Napoleon    Knows by experience, now, Bagration,    And dare not Hercul
ean Russians trouble...  But before he had finished reading, a stentorian majordo
mo announced that dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the dining room cam
e the resounding strains of the polonaise     Conquest's joyful thunder waken,   
 Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...  and Count Rostov, glancing angrily at the au
thor who went on reading his verses, bowed to Bagration. Everyone rose, feeling t
hat dinner was more important than verses, and Bagration, again preceding all the
 rest, went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between two Alexand
ersBekleshev and Naryshkinwhich was a significant allusion to the name of the sov
ereign. Three hundred persons took their seats in the dining room, according to t
heir rank and importance the more important nearer to the honored guest, as natur
ally as water flows deepest where the land lies lowest.  Just before dinner, Coun
t Ilya Rostov presented his son to Bagration, who recognized him and said a few w
ords to him, disjointed and awkward, as were all the words he spoke that day, and
 Count Ilya looked joyfully and proudly around while Bagration spoke to his son. 
 Nicholas Rostov, with Denisov and his new acquaintance, Dolokhov, sat almost at 
the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince Nesvitski. Count I
lya Rostov with the other members of the committee sat facing Bagration and, as t
he very personification of Moscow hospitality, did the honors to the prince.  His
 efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and the other fare, wa
s splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the end of the meal. He wink
ed at the butler, whispered directions to the footmen, and awaited each expected 
dish with some anxiety. Everything was excellent. With the second course, a gigan
tic sterlet at sight of which Ilya Rostov blushed with selfconscious pleasure, th
e footmen began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses. After the fish, 
which made a certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with the other commit
teemen. "There will be many toasts, it's time to begin," he whispered, and taking
 up his glass, he rose. All were silent, waiting for what he would say.  "To the 
health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!" he cried, and at the same moment his kindl
y eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm. The band immediately struck u
p "Conquest's joyful thunder waken..." All rose and cried "Hurrah!" Bagration als
o rose and shouted "Hurrah!" in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted it
 on the field at Schon Grabern. Young Rostov's ecstatic voice could be heard abov
e the three hundred others. He nearly wept. "To the health of our Sovereign, the 
Emperor!" he roared, "Hurrah!" and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to
 the floor. Many followed his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long
 time. When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass and ev
erybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging remarks
. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside his plate, and pro
posed a toast, "To the health of the hero of our last campaign, Prince Peter Ivan
ovich Bagration!" and again his blue eyes grew moist. "Hurrah!" cried the three h
undred voices again, but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata comp
osed by Paul Ivanovich Kutuzov     Russians! O'er all barriers on!    Courage con
quest guarantees    Have we not Bagration?    He brings foe men to their knees,..
. etc.   As soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was proposed 
and Count Ilya Rostov became more and more moved, more glass was smashed, and the
 shouting grew louder. They drank to Bekleshev, Naryshkin, Uvarov, Dolgorukov, Ap
raksin, Valuev, to the committee, to all the Club members and to all the Club gue
sts, and finally to Count Ilya Rostov separately, as the organizer of the banquet
. At that toast, the count took out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept
 outright.      CHAPTER IV   Pierre sat opposite Dolokhov and Nicholas Rostov. As
 usual, he ate and drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately not
iced that some great change had come over him that day. He was silent all through
 dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and a look o
f complete absentmindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his nose. His face was de
pressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on around
 him and to be absorbed by some depressing and unsolved problem.  The unsolved pr
oblem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the princess, his cousin, a
t Moscow, concerning Dolokhov's intimacy with his wife, and by an anonymous lette
r he had received that morning, which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous
 letters said that he saw badly through his spectacles, but that his wife's conne
ction with Dolokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely disbeli
eved both the princess' hints and the letter, but he feared now to look at Dolokh
ov, who was sitting opposite him. Every time he chanced to meet Dolokhov's handso
me insolent eyes, Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul
 and turned quickly away. Involuntarily recalling his wife's past and her relatio
ns with Dolokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be tr
ue, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife. He involun
tarily remembered how Dolokhov, who had fully recovered his former position after
 the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come to him. Availing himself of hi
s friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion, Dolokhov had come straight 
to his house, and Pierre had put him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how H
elene had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dolokhov's living at their house, an
d how cynically Dolokhov had praised his wife's beauty to him and from that time 
till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day.  "Yes, he is very handsome,
" thought Pierre, "and I know him. It would be particularly pleasant to him to di
shonor my name and ridicule me, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf,
 befriended him, and helped him. I know and understand what a spice that would ad
d to the pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true, 
but I do not believe it. I have no right to, and can't, believe it." He remembere
d the expression Dolokhov's face assumed in his moments of cruelty, as when tying
 the policeman to the bear and dropping them into the water, or when he challenge
d a man to a duel without any reason, or shot a postboy's horse with a pistol. Th
at expression was often on Dolokhov's face when looking at him. "Yes, he is a bul
ly," thought Pierre, "to kill a man means nothing to him. It must seem to him tha
t everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him. He must think that I, too,
 am afraid of himand in fact I am afraid of him," he thought, and again he felt s
omething terrible and monstrous rising in his soul. Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov
 were now sitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rostov was talking merrily
 to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious d
uelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose pr
eoccupied, absentminded, and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinn
er. Rostov looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre appeared to his huss
ar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in a wordan old woman an
d secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation and absentmindedness had not recog
nized Rostov and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor's health was
 drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.  "What are you a
bout?" shouted Rostov, looking at him in an ecstasy of exasperation. "Don't you h
ear it's His Majesty the Emperor's health?"  Pierre sighed, rose submissively, em
ptied his glass, and, waiting till all were seated again, turned with his kindly 
smile to Rostov.  "Why, I didn't recognize you!" he said. But Rostov was otherwis
e engaged he was shouting "Hurrah!"  "Why don't you renew the acquaintance?" said
 Dolokhov to Rostov.  "Confound him, he's a fool!" said Rostov.  "One should make
 up to the husbands of pretty women," said Denisov.  Pierre did not catch what th
ey were saying, but knew they were talking about him. He reddened and turned away
.  "Well, now to the health of handsome women!" said Dolokhov, and with a serious
 expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth, he turned with
 his glass to Pierre.  "Here's to the health of lovely women, Peterkinand their l
overs!" he added.  Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without loo
king at Dolokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets wit
h Kutuzov's cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the principal guests. He wa
s just going to take it when Dolokhov, leaning across, snatched it from his hand 
and began reading it. Pierre looked at Dolokhov and his eyes dropped, the somethi
ng terrible and monstrous that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took pos
session of him. He leaned his whole massive body across the table.  "How dare you
 take it?" he shouted.  Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nes
vitski and the neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezukhov.  "Don't
! Don't! What are you about?" whispered their frightened voices.  Dolokhov looked
 at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that smile of his which seemed t
o say, "Ah! This is what I like!"  "You shan't have it!" he said distinctly.  Pal
e, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.  "You...! you... scoundrel! I c
hallenge you!" he ejaculated, and, pushing back his chair, he rose from the table
.  At the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt that the 
question of his wife's guilt which had been tormenting him the whole day was fina
lly and indubitably answered in the affirmative. He hated her and was forever sun
dered from her. Despite Denisov's request that he would take no part in the matte
r, Rostov agreed to be Dolokhov's second, and after dinner he discussed the arran
gements for the duel with Nesvitski, Bezukhov's second. Pierre went home, but Ros
tov with Dolokhov and Denisov stayed on at the Club till late, listening to the g
ypsies and other singers.  "Well then, till tomorrow at Sokolniki," said Dolokhov
, as he took leave of Rostov in the Club porch.  "And do you feel quite calm?" Ro
stov asked.  Dolokhov paused.  "Well, you see, I'll tell you the whole secret of 
dueling in two words. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and w
rite affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be killed, yo
u are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm intention of killing 
your man as quickly and surely as possible, and then all will be right, as our be
ar huntsman at Kostroma used to tell me. 'Everyone fears a bear,' he says, 'but w
hen you see one your fear's all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get
 away!' And that's how it is with me. A demain, mon cher." *       * Till tomorro
w, my dear fellow.   Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvitski drov
e to the Sokolniki forest and found Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov already there. 
Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no connecti
on with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow. He had evidently not sle
pt that night. He looked about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled
 by the sun. He was entirely absorbed by two considerations his wife's guilt, of 
which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltless
ness of Dolokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothin
g to him.... "I should perhaps have done the same thing in his place," thought Pi
erre. "It's even certain that I should have done the same, then why this duel, th
is murder? Either I shall kill him, or he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or k
nee. Can't I go away from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?" passed through 
his mind. But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in
 a particularly calm and absentminded way, which inspired the respect of the onlo
okers, "Will it be long? Are things ready?"  When all was ready, the sabers stuck
 in the snow to mark the barriers, and the pistols loaded, Nesvitski went up to P
ierre.  "I should not be doing my duty, Count," he said in timid tones, "and shou
ld not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in choosing me for 
your second, if at this grave, this very grave, moment I did not tell you the who
le truth. I think there is no sufficient ground for this affair, or for blood to 
be shed over it.... You were not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuou
s..."  "Oh yes, it is horribly stupid," said Pierre.  "Then allow me to express y
our regrets, and I am sure your opponent will accept them," said Nesvitski who li
ke the others concerned in the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did no
t yet believe that the affair had come to an actual duel. "You know, Count, it is
 much more honorable to admit one's mistake than to let matters become irreparabl
e. There was no insult on either side. Allow me to convey...."  "No! What is ther
e to talk about?" said Pierre. "It's all the same.... Is everything ready?" he ad
ded. "Only tell me where to go and where to shoot," he said with an unnaturally g
entle smile.  He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working o
f the trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his handa fact that he did n
ot wish to confess.  "Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot," said he.  "No ap
ologies, none whatever," said Dolokhov to Denisov who on his side had been attemp
ting a reconciliation, and he also went up to the appointed place.  The spot chos
en for the duel was some eighty paces from the road, where the sleighs had been l
eft, in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow, the frost 
having begun to break up during the last few days. The antagonists stood forty pa
ces apart at the farther edge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces, 
left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing a
nd Nesvitski's and Dolokhov's sabers, which were stuck into the ground ten paces 
apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and misty at forty paces' distance noth
ing could be seen. For three minutes all had been ready, but they still delayed a
nd all were silent.      CHAPTER V   "Well begin!" said Dolokhov.  "All right," s
aid Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling of dread was in the air. It 
was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was t
aking its course independently of men's will.  Denisov first went to the barrier 
and announced "As the adve'sawies have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. 
Take your pistols, and at the word thwee begin to advance.  "One! Two! Thwee!" he
 shouted angrily and stepped aside.  The combatants advanced along the trodden tr
acks, nearer and nearer to one another, beginning to see one another through the 
mist. They had the right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier. 
Dolokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his brig
ht, sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist's face. His mouth wore its usual semb
lance of a smile.  "So I can fire when I like!" said Pierre, and at the word "thr
ee," he went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep
 snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at arm's length, apparently afraid of
 shooting himself with it. His left hand he held carefully back, because he wishe
d to support his right hand with it and knew he must not do so. Having advanced s
ix paces and strayed off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet,
 then quickly glanced at Dolokhov and, bending his finger as he had been shown, f
ired. Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered at the sound and th
en, smiling at his own sensations, stood still. The smoke, rendered denser by the
 mist, prevented him from seeing anything for an instant, but there was no second
 report as he had expected. He only heard Dolokhov's hurried steps, and his figur
e came in view through the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his left side, whil
e the other clutched his drooping pistol. His face was pale. Rostov ran toward hi
m and said something.  "Nooo!" muttered Dolokhov through his teeth, "no, it's not
 over." And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber, he sank
 on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody he wiped it on his coat and supp
orted himself with it. His frowning face was pallid and quivered.  "Plea..." bega
n Dolokhov, but could not at first pronounce the word.  "Please," he uttered with
 an effort.  Pierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward Dolokhov a
nd was about to cross the space between the barriers, when Dolokhov cried  "To yo
ur barrier!" and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by his saber. Only ten 
paces divided them. Dolokhov lowered his head to the snow, greedily bit at it, ag
ain raised his head, adjusted himself, drew in his legs and sat up, seeking a fir
m center of gravity. He sucked and swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but
 his eyes, still smiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered h
is remaining strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.  "Sideways! Cover yourself
 with your pistol!" ejaculated Nesvitski.  "Cover yourself!" even Denisov cried t
o his adversary.  Pierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and l
egs helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing Dolokhov lo
oked sorrowfully at him. Denisov, Rostov, and Nesvitski closed their eyes. At the
 same instant they heard a report and Dolokhov's angry cry.  "Missed!" shouted Do
lokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards on the snow.  Pierre clutched his t
emples, and turning round went into the forest, trampling through the deep snow, 
and muttering incoherent words  "Folly... folly! Death... lies..." he repeated, p
uckering his face.  Nesvitski stopped him and took him home.  Rostov and Denisov 
drove away with the wounded Dolokhov.  The latter lay silent in the sleigh with c
losed eyes and did not answer a word to the questions addressed to him. But on en
tering Moscow he suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took Rost
ov, who was sitting beside him, by the hand. Rostov was struck by the totally alt
ered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on Dolokhov's face.  "Well?
 How do you feel?" he asked.  "Bad! But it's not that, my friend" said Dolokhov w
ith a gasping voice. "Where are we? In Moscow, I know. I don't matter, but I have
 killed her, killed... She won't get over it! She won't survive...."  "Who?" aske
d Rostov.  "My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother," and Dolokhov
 pressed Rostov's hand and burst into tears.  When he had become a little quieter
, he explained to Rostov that he was living with his mother, who, if she saw him 
dying, would not survive it. He implored Rostov to go on and prepare her.  Rostov
 went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise learned that Dolok
hov the brawler, Dolokhov the bully, lived in Moscow with an old mother and a hun
chback sister, and was the most affectionate of sons and brothers.      CHAPTER V
I   Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in Mosc
ow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the duel he did not g
o to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his father's room, that huge r
oom in which Count Bezukhov had died.  He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall as
leep and forget all that had happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm o
f feelings, thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fa
ll asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the room wit
h rapid steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage, with
 bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on her face, and then immediately 
he saw beside her Dolokhov's handsome, insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had
 seen it at the banquet, and then that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, 
as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow.  "What has happened?" he aske
d himself. "I have killed her lover, yes, killed my wife's lover. Yes, that was i
t! And why? How did I come to do it?""Because you married her," answered an inner
 voice.  "But in what was I to blame?" he asked. "In marrying her without loving 
her in deceiving yourself and her." And he vividly recalled that moment after sup
per at Prince Vasili's, when he spoke those words he had found so difficult to ut
ter "I love you." "It all comes from that! Even then I felt it," he thought. "I f
elt then that it was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out." 
 He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection. Particularly vivid,
 humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of how one day soon after his mar
riage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little before noon in his silk 
dressing gown and found his head steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked 
into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing resp
ectful understanding of his employer's happiness.  "But how often I have felt pro
ud of her, proud of her majestic beauty and social tact," thought he "been proud 
of my house, in which she received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability
 and beauty. So this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did not unders
tand her. How often when considering her character I have told myself that I was 
to blame for not understanding her, for not understanding that constant composure
 and complacency and lack of all interests or desires, and the whole secret lies 
in the terrible truth that she is a depraved woman. Now I have spoken that terrib
le word to myself all has become clear.  "Anatole used to come to borrow money fr
om her and used to kiss her naked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but 
let herself be kissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she re
plied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous 'Let him do w
hat he pleases,' she used to say of me. One day I asked her if she felt any sympt
oms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want 
to have children, and that she was not going to have any children by me."  Then h
e recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the 
expressions that were natural to her, though she had been brought up in the most 
aristocratic circles.  "I'm not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allezvous 
promener," * she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with young and old
 men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not love her.       * "You 
clear out of this."   "Yes, I never loved her," said he to himself "I knew she wa
s a depraved woman," he repeated, "but dared not admit it to myself. And now ther
e's Dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying, while mee
ting my remorse with some forced bravado!"  Pierre was one of those people who, i
n spite of an appearance of what is called weak character, do not seek a confidan
t in their troubles. He digested his sufferings alone.  "It is all, all her fault
," he said to himself "but what of that? Why did I bind myself to her? Why did I 
say 'Je vous aime' * to her, which was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty a
nd must endure... what? A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that's nons
ense," he thought. "The slur on my name and honorthat's all apart from myself."  
     * I love you.   "Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorabl
e and a criminal," came into Pierre's head, "and from their point of view they we
re right, as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr's death for his s
ake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot. Who is right and who is wr
ong? No one! But if you are alivelive tomorrow you'll die as I might have died an
 hour ago. And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life
 in comparison with eternity?"  But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed
 by such reflections, she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments w
hen he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the bl
ood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break and tear w
hatever came to his hand. "Why did I tell her that 'Je vous aime'?" he kept repea
ting to himself. And when he had said it for the tenth time, Molibre's words "Mai
s que diable alloitil faire dans cette galere?" occurred to him, and he began to 
laugh at himself.  In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go
 to Petersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He resolved t
o go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his intention to part from
 her forever.  Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pi
erre was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.  He woke up a
nd looked round for a while with a startled expression, unable to realize where h
e was.  "The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home," sa
id the valet.  But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the coun
tess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with simp
ly dressed hair two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a coronet ent
ered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her
 rather prominent marble brow. With her imperturbable calm she did not begin to s
peak in front of the valet. She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it. 
She waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and left the room. Pierr
e looked at her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds
 who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her enemies, he
 tried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless and impossible, he a
gain glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down but looked at him with a contem
ptuous smile, waiting for the valet to go.  "Well, what's this now? What have you
 been up to now, I should like to know?" she asked sternly.  "I? What have I...?"
 stammered Pierre.  "So it seems you're a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel 
about? What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you."  Pierre turned over heavily o
n the ottoman and opened his mouth, but could not reply.  "If you won't answer, I
'll tell you..." Helene went on. "You believe everything you're told. You were to
ld..." Helene laughed, "that Dolokhov was my lover," she said in French with her 
coarse plainness of speech, uttering the word amant as casually as any other word
, "and you believed it! Well, what have you proved? What does this duel prove? Th
at you're a fool, que vous etes un sot, but everybody knew that. What will be the
 result? That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow, that everyone will say 
that you, drunk and not knowing what you were about, challenged a man you are jea
lous of without cause." Helene raised her voice and became more and more excited,
 "A man who's a better man than you in every way..."  "Hm... Hm...!" growled Pier
re, frowning without looking at her, and not moving a muscle.  "And how could you
 believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like his company? If you were cleverer a
nd more agreeable, I should prefer yours."  "Don't speak to me... I beg you," mut
tered Pierre hoarsely.  "Why shouldn't I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell
 you plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would no
t have taken lovers des amants, but I have not done so," said she.  Pierre wished
 to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange expression she did not u
nderstand, and lay down again. He was suffering physically at that moment, there 
was a weight on his chest and he could not breathe. He knew that he must do somet
hing to put an end to this suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible. 
 "We had better separate," he muttered in a broken voice.  "Separate? Very well, 
but only if you give me a fortune," said Helene. "Separate! That's a thing to fri
ghten me with!"  Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.
  "I'll kill you!" he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table with a stren
gth he had never before felt, he made a step toward her brandishing the slab.  He
lene's face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His father's nature s
howed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and delight of frenzy. He flung d
own the slab, broke it, and swooping down on her with outstretched hands shouted,
 "Get out!" in such a terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror. G
od knows what he would have done at that moment had Helene not fled from the room
.   A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates in Gr
eat Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left for Petersburg
 alone.      CHAPTER VII   Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of
 Austerlitz and the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of
 the letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had not
 been found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What was worst of all for his re
lations was the fact that there was still a possibility of his having been picked
 up on the battlefield by the people of the place and that he might now be lying,
 recovering or dying, alone among strangers and unable to send news of himself. T
he gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz sta
ted, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russ
ians had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The old p
rince understood from this official report that our army had been defeated. A wee
k after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kutuzov
 informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son.  "Your son," wrote K
utuzov, "fell before my eyes, a standard in his hand and at the head of a regimen
the fell as a hero, worthy of his father and his fatherland. To the great regret 
of myself and of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not.
 I comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he 
would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle, a list
 of whom has been sent me under flag of truce."  After receiving this news late i
n the evening, when he was alone in his study, the old prince went for his walk a
s usual next morning, but he was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the a
rchitect, and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.  When Princes
s Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his lathe and, as usual, d
id not look round at her.  "Ah, Princess Mary!" he said suddenly in an unnatural 
voice, throwing down his chisel. The wheel continued to revolve by its own impetu
s, and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel, which merged 
in her memory with what followed.  She approached him, saw his face, and somethin
g gave way within her. Her eyes grew dim. By the expression of her father's face,
 not sad, not crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging ov
er her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst in life, on
e she had not yet experienced, irreparable and incomprehensiblethe death of one s
he loved.  "Father! Andrew!"said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such an in
describable charm of sorrow and selfforgetfulness that her father could not bear 
her look but turned away with a sob.  "Bad news! He's not among the prisoners nor
 among the killed! Kutuzov writes..." and he screamed as piercingly as if he wish
ed to drive the princess away by that scream... "Killed!"  The princess did not f
all down or faint. She was already pale, but on hearing these words her face chan
ged and something brightened in her beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joya su
preme joy apart from the joys and sorrows of this worldoverflowed the great grief
 within her. She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, an
d drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.  "Father," she said,
 "do not turn away from me, let us weep together."  "Scoundrels! Blackguards!" sh
rieked the old man, turning his face away from her. "Destroying the army, destroy
ing the men! And why? Go, go and tell Lise."  The princess sank helplessly into a
n armchair beside her father and wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at 
the moment when he took leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She 
saw him tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. "Did he belie
ve? Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms of ete
rnal peace and blessedness?" she thought.  "Father, tell me how it happened," she
 asked through her tears.  "Go! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian m
en and Russia's glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell Lis
e. I will follow."  When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princ
ess sat working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm p
eculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see Princess Mary
 but were looking within... into herself... at something joyful and mysterious ta
king place within her.  "Mary," she said, moving away from the embroidery frame a
nd lying back, "give me your hand." She took her sisterinlaw's hand and held it b
elow her waist.  Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remain
ed lifted in childlike happiness.  Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid he
r face in the folds of her sisterinlaw's dress.  "There, there! Do you feel it? I
 feel so strange. And do you know, Mary, I am going to love him very much," said 
Lise, looking with bright and happy eyes at her sisterinlaw.  Princess Mary could
 not lift her head, she was weeping.  "What is the matter, Mary?"  "Nothing... on
ly I feel sad... sad about Andrew," she said, wiping away her tears on her sister
inlaw's knee.  Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began try
ing to prepare her sisterinlaw, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as was t
he little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not understand, agita
ted her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something.
 Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was always afraid, came into her room 
with a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without sayin
g a word. She looked at Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that ex
pression of attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women
, and suddenly began to cry.  "Has anything come from Andrew?" she asked.  "No, y
ou know it's too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I feel afraid."  "So
 there's nothing?"  "Nothing," answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her ra
diant eyes at her sisterinlaw.  She had determined not to tell her and persuaded 
her father to hide the terrible news from her till after her confinement, which w
as expected within a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid
 their grief in their own way. The old prince would not cherish any hope he made 
up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he sent an official to
 Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a monument from Moscow which h
e intended to erect in his own garden to his memory, and he told everybody that h
is son had been killed. He tried not to change his former way of life, but his st
rength failed him. He walked less, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every 
day. Princess Mary hoped. She prayed for her brother as living and was always awa
iting news of his return.      CHAPTER VIII   "Dearest," said the little princess
 after breakfast on the morning of the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip
 rose from old habit, but as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of eve
ry word, and even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, 
so now the smile of the little princessinfluenced by the general mood though with
out knowing its causewas such as to remind one still more of the general sorrow. 
 "Dearest, I'm afraid this morning's fruschtique *as Foka the cook calls ithas di
sagreed with me."       * Fruhstuck breakfast.   "What is the matter with you, my
 darling? You look pale. Oh, you are very pale!" said Princess Mary in alarm, run
ning with her soft, ponderous steps up to her sisterinlaw.  "Your excellency, sho
uld not Mary Bogdanovna be sent for?" said one of the maids who was present. Mary
 Bogdanovna was a midwife from the neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills f
or the last fortnight.  "Oh yes," assented Princess Mary, "perhaps that's it. I'l
l go. Courage, my angel." She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.  "Oh, 
no, no!" And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little princess
' face, an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain showed itself.  "No, it
's only indigestion?... Say it's only indigestion, say so, Mary! Say..." And the 
little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her
 little hands even with some affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fe
tch Mary Bogdanovna.  "Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!" she heard as she left the room.  
The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump white ha
nds with an air of calm importance.  "Mary Bogdanovna, I think it's beginning!" s
aid Princess Mary looking at the midwife with wideopen eyes of alarm.  "Well, the
 Lord be thanked, Princess," said Mary Bogdanovna, not hastening her steps. "You 
young ladies should not know anything about it."  "But how is it the doctor from 
Moscow is not here yet?" said the princess. In accordance with Lise's and Prince 
Andrew's wishes they had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expect
ing him at any moment.  "No matter, Princess, don't be alarmed," said Mary Bogdan
ovna. "We'll manage very well without a doctor."  Five minutes later Princess Mar
y from her room heard something heavy being carried by. She looked out. The men s
ervants were carrying the large leather sofa from Prince Andrew's study into the 
bedroom. On their faces was a quiet and solemn look.  Princess Mary sat alone in 
her room listening to the sounds in the house, now and then opening her door when
 someone passed and watching what was going on in the passage. Some women passing
 with quiet steps in and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned aw
ay. She did not venture to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sittin
g down in her easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before the ico
n stand. To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers did not calm her
 excitement. Suddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse, Praskovya Savishn
a, who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden it, appeared
 on the threshold with a shawl round her head.  "I've come to sit with you a bit,
 Masha," said the nurse, "and here I've brought the prince's wedding candles to l
ight before his saint, my angel," she said with a sigh.  "Oh, nurse, I'm so glad!
"  "God is merciful, birdie."  The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons an
d sat down by the door with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began rea
ding. Only when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another, the 
princess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging. Everyone in the house was 
dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced as she sat in her ro
om. But owing to the superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the le
ss a woman in travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not to know no one spoke
 of it, but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in
 the prince's household, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a consci
ousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished at that moment
 made itself felt.  There was no laughter in the maids' large hall. In the men se
rvants' hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs' quarters
 torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old prince, stepping on h
is heels, paced up and down his study and sent Tikhon to ask Mary Bogdanovna what
 news."Say only that 'the prince told me to ask,' and come and tell me her answer
."  "Inform the prince that labor has begun," said Mary Bogdanovna, giving the me
ssenger a significant look.  Tikhon went and told the prince.  "Very good!" said 
the prince closing the door behind him, and Tikhon did not hear the slightest sou
nd from the study after that.  After a while he reentered it as if to snuff the c
andles, and, seeing the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his 
perturbed face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the sh
oulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he had entere
d. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course. Evening passed, nig
ht came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of heart in the presence of th
e unfathomable did not lessen but increased. No one slept.  It was one of those M
arch nights when winter seems to wish to resume its sway and scatters its last sn
ows and storms with desperate fury. A relay of horses had been sent up the highro
ad to meet the German doctor from Moscow who was expected every moment, and men o
n horseback with lanterns were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the count
ry road with its hollows and snowcovered pools of water.  Princess Mary had long 
since put aside her book she sat silent, her luminous eyes fixed on her nurse's w
rinkled face every line of which she knew so well, on the lock of gray hair that 
escaped from under the kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.  Nu
rse Savishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely hearing or und
erstanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of times before how the late
 princess had given birth to Princess Mary in Kishenev with only a Moldavian peas
ant woman to help instead of a midwife.  "God is merciful, doctors are never need
ed," she said.  Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of th
e window, from which the double frame had been removed by order of the prince, on
e window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks returned, and, forci
ng open a loosely closed latch, set the damask curtain flapping and blew out the 
candle with its chill, snowy draft. Princess Mary shuddered her nurse, putting do
wn the stocking she was knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to cat
ch the open casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loos
e locks of gray hair.  "Princess, my dear, there's someone driving up the avenue!
" she said, holding the casement and not closing it. "With lanterns. Most likely 
the doctor."  "Oh, my God! thank God!" said Princess Mary. "I must go and meet hi
m, he does not know Russian."  Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran 
to meet the newcomer. As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window
 a carriage with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. 
On a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On the land
ing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding another candle. 
Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one could hear the footstep of som
eone in thick felt boots, and a voice that seemed familiar to Princess Mary was s
aying something.  "Thank God!" said the voice. "And Father?"  "Gone to bed," repl
ied the voice of Demyan the house steward, who was downstairs.  Then the voice sa
id something more, Demyan replied, and the steps in the felt boots approached the
 unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.  "It's Andrew!" thought Princess Mary
. "No it can't be, that would be too extraordinary," and at the very moment she t
hought this, the face and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar
 of which covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman stood with
 the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and strangely softened bu
t agitated expression on his face. He came up the stairs and embraced his sister.
  "You did not get my letter?" he asked, and not waiting for a replywhich he woul
d not have received, for the princess was unable to speakhe turned back, rapidly 
mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had entered the hall after him they 
had met at the last post station, and again embraced his sister.  "What a strange
 fate, Masha darling!" And having taken off his cloak and felt boots, he went to 
the little princess' apartment.      CHAPTER IX   The little princess lay support
ed by pillows, with a white cap on her head the pains had just left her. Strands 
of her black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy
 mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew en
tered and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying. Her g
littering eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested on him without 
changing their expression. "I love you all and have done no harm to anyone why mu
st I suffer so? Help me!" her look seemed to say. She saw her husband, but did no
t realize the significance of his appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went r
ound the sofa and kissed her forehead.  "My darling!" he saida word he had never 
used to her before. "God is merciful...."  She looked at him inquiringly and with
 childlike reproach.  "I expected help from you and I get none, none from you eit
her!" said her eyes. She was not surprised at his having come she did not realize
 that he had come. His coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or with their
 relief. The pangs began again and Mary Bogdanovna advised Prince Andrew to leave
 the room.  The doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess Mary
, again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk broke off at e
very moment. They waited and listened.  "Go, dear," said Princess Mary.  Prince A
ndrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next to hers. A woman ca
me from the bedroom with a frightened face and became confused when she saw Princ
e Andrew. He covered his face with his hands and remained so for some minutes. Pi
teous, helpless, animal moans came through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went t
o the door, and tried to open it. Someone was holding it shut.  "You can't come i
n! You can't!" said a terrified voice from within.  He began pacing the room. The
 screaming ceased, and a few more seconds went by. Then suddenly a terrible shrie
kit could not be hers, she could not scream like thatcame from the bedroom. Princ
e Andrew ran to the door the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.  "
What have they taken a baby in there for?" thought Prince Andrew in the first sec
ond. "A baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or is the baby born?"  The
n suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail tears choked him, and
 leaning his elbows on the window sill be began to cry, sobbing like a child. The
 door opened. The doctor with his shirt sleeves tucked up, without a coat, pale a
nd with a trembling jaw, came out of the room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but t
he doctor gave him a bewildered look and passed by without a word. A woman rushed
 out and seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the threshold. He went into 
his wife's room. She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen her in five
 minutes before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks, the sam
e expression was on her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with t
iny black hair.  "I love you all, and have done no harm to anyone and what have y
ou done to me?"said her charming, pathetic, dead face.  In a corner of the room s
omething red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed in Mary Bogdanovna's trembling wh
ite hands.   Two hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his father
's room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to the door a
nd as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise round his son's nec
k, and without a word he began to sob like a child.   Three days later the little
 princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went up the steps to where the coffin sto
od, to give her the farewell kiss. And there in the coffin was the same face, tho
ugh with closed eyes. "Ah, what have you done to me?" it still seemed to say, and
 Prince Andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of
 a sin he could neither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. The old man too cam
e up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one on the other 
on her breast, and to him, too, her face seemed to say "Ah, what have you done to
 me, and why?" And at the sight the old man turned angrily away.   Another five d
ays passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas Andreevich was baptized. The wet n
urse supported the coverlet with her chin, while the priest with a goose feather 
anointed the boy's little red and wrinkled soles and palms.  His grandfather, who
 was his godfather, trembling and afraid of dropping him, carried the infant roun
d the battered tin font and handed him over to the godmother, Princess Mary. Prin
ce Andrew sat in another room, faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in
 the font, and awaited the termination of the ceremony. He looked up joyfully at 
the baby when the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him t
hat the wax with the baby's hair had not sunk in the font but had floated.      C
HAPTER X   Rostov's share in Dolokhov's duel with Bezukhov was hushed up by the e
fforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks as he expecte
d he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of Moscow. As a result he 
could not go to the country with the rest of the family, but was kept all summer 
in Moscow by his new duties. Dolokhov recovered, and Rostov became very friendly 
with him during his convalescence. Dolokhov lay ill at his mother's who loved him
 passionately and tenderly, and old Mary Ivanovna, who had grown fond of Rostov f
or his friendship to her Fedya, often talked to him about her son.  "Yes, Count,"
 she would say, "he is too noble and puresouled for our present, depraved world. 
No one now loves virtue it seems like a reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count,
 was it right, was it honorable, of Bezukhov? And Fedya, with his noble spirit, l
oved him and even now never says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg w
hen they played some tricks on a policeman, didn't they do it together? And there
! Bezukhov got off scotfree, while Fedya had to bear the whole burden on his shou
lders. Fancy what he had to go through! It's true he has been reinstated, but how
 could they fail to do that? I think there were not many such gallant sons of the
 fatherland out there as he. And nowthis duel! Have these people no feeling, or h
onor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so straight! It's
 well God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who doesn't have intrigues nowada
ys? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see things he should have shown it sooner, bu
t he lets it go on for months. And then to call him out, reckoning on Fedya not f
ighting because he owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you under
stand Fedya, my dear count that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few peop
le do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!"  Dolokhov himself durin
g his convalescence spoke to Rostov in a way no one would have expected of him.  
"I know people consider me a bad man!" he said. "Let them! I don't care a straw a
bout anyone but those I love but those I love, I love so that I would give my lif
e for them, and the others I'd throttle if they stood in my way. I have an adored
, a priceless mother, and two or three friendsyou among themand as for the rest I
 only care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful. And most of them a
re harmful, especially the women. Yes, dear boy," he continued, "I have met lovin
g, noble, highminded men, but I have not yet met any womencountesses or cookswho 
were not venal. I have not yet met that divine purity and devotion I look for in 
women. If I found such a one I'd give my life for her! But those!..." and he made
 a gesture of contempt. "And believe me, if I still value my life it is only beca
use I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who will regenerate, purify, and
 elevate me. But you don't understand it."  "Oh, yes, I quite understand," answer
ed Rostov, who was under his new friend's influence.  In the autumn the Rostovs r
eturned to Moscow. Early in the winter Denisov also came back and stayed with the
m. The first half of the winter of 1806, which Nicholas Rostov spent in Moscow, w
as one of the happiest, merriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas bro
ught many young men to his parents' house. Vera was a handsome girl of twenty Son
ya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower Natasha, half grown 
up and half child, was now childishly amusing, now girlishly enchanting.  At that
 time in the Rostovs' house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere characteristic 
of homes where there are very young and very charming girls. Every young man who 
came to the houseseeing those impressionable, smiling young faces smiling probabl
y at their own happiness, feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fi
tful bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of young 
girls ready for anything and full of hopeexperienced the same feeling sharing wit
h the young folk of the Rostovs' household a readiness to fall in love and an exp
ectation of happiness.  Among the young men introduced by Rostov one of the first
 was Dolokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except Natasha. She almost quarre
led with her brother about him. She insisted that he was a bad man, and that in t
he duel with Bezukhov, Pierre was right and Dolokhov wrong, and further that he w
as disagreeable and unnatural.  "There's nothing for me to understand," she cried
 out with resolute selfwill, "he is wicked and heartless. There now, I like your 
Denisov though he is a rake and all that, still I like him so you see I do unders
tand. I don't know how to put it... with this one everything is calculated, and I
 don't like that. But Denisov..."  "Oh, Denisov is quite different," replied Nich
olas, implying that even Denisov was nothing compared to Dolokhov"you must unders
tand what a soul there is in Dolokhov, you should see him with his mother. What a
 heart!"  "Well, I don't know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And do
 you know he has fallen in love with Sonya?"  "What nonsense..."  "I'm certain of
 it you'll see."  Natasha's prediction proved true. Dolokhov, who did not usually
 care for the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the questi
on for whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soon settled. He came bec
ause of Sonya. And Sonya, though she would never have dared to say so, knew it an
d blushed scarlet every time Dolokhov appeared.  Dolokhov often dined at the Rost
ovs', never missed a performance at which they were present, and went to Iogel's 
balls for young people which the Rostovs always attended. He was pointedly attent
ive to Sonya and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
 glances without coloring, but even the old countess and Natasha blushed when the
y saw his looks.  It was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irre
sistible influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.  Rostov noticed 
something new in Dolokhov's relations with Sonya, but he did not explain to himse
lf what these new relations were. "They're always in love with someone," he thoug
ht of Sonya and Natasha. But he was not as much at ease with Sonya and Dolokhov a
s before and was less frequently at home.  In the autumn of 1806 everybody had ag
ain begun talking of the war with Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year
 before. Orders were given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the r
egular army, and besides this, nine men in every thousand for the militia. Everyw
here Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war was tal
ked of. For the Rostov family the whole interest of these preparations for war la
y in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of remaining in Moscow, and only await
ed the termination of Denisov's furlough after Christmas to return with him to th
eir regiment. His approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself, but 
rather gave zest to his pleasures. He spent the greater part of his time away fro
m home, at dinners, parties, and balls.      CHAPTER XI   On the third day after 
Christmas Nicholas dined at home, a thing he had rarely done of late. It was a gr
and farewell dinner, as he and Denisov were leaving to join their regiment after 
Epiphany. About twenty people were present, including Dolokhov and Denisov.  Neve
r had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous atmosphere made its
elf so strongly felt in the Rostovs' house as at this holiday time. "Seize the mo
ments of happiness, love and be loved! That is the only reality in the world, all
 else is folly. It is the one thing we are interested in here," said the spirit o
f the place.  Nicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without vi
siting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited, returned h
ome just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and felt the tension of 
the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a curious embarrassment among some
 of those present. Sonya, Dolokhov, and the old countess were especially disturbe
d, and to a lesser degree Natasha. Nicholas understood that something must have h
appened between Sonya and Dolokhov before dinner, and with the kindly sensitivene
ss natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner. On that same
 evening there was to be one of the balls that Iogel the dancing master gave for 
his pupils during the holidays.  "Nicholas, will you come to Iogel's? Please do!"
 said Natasha. "He asked you, and Vasili Dmitrich * is also going."       * Denis
ov.   "Where would I not go at the countess' command!" said Denisov, who at the R
ostovs' had jocularly assumed the role of Natasha's knight. "I'm even weady to da
nce the pas de chale."  "If I have time," answered Nicholas. "But I promised the 
Arkharovs they have a party."  "And you?" he asked Dolokhov, but as soon as he ha
d asked the question he noticed that it should not have been put.  "Perhaps," col
dly and angrily replied Dolokhov, glancing at Sonya, and, scowling, he gave Nicho
las just such a look as he had given Pierre at the Club dinner.  "There is someth
ing up," thought Nicholas, and he was further confirmed in this conclusion by the
 fact that Dolokhov left immediately after dinner. He called Natasha and asked he
r what was the matter.  "And I was looking for you," said Natasha running out to 
him. "I told you, but you would not believe it," she said triumphantly. "He has p
roposed to Sonya!"  Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sonya of late, s
omething seemed to give way within him at this news. Dolokhov was a suitable and 
in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From the point
 of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the question for her to
 refuse him. And therefore Nicholas' first feeling on hearing the news was one of
 anger with Sonya.... He tried to say, "That's capital of course she'll forget he
r childish promises and accept the offer," but before he had time to say it Natas
ha began again.  "And fancy! she refused him quite definitely!" adding, after a p
ause, "she told him she loved another."  "Yes, my Sonya could not have done other
wise!" thought Nicholas.  "Much as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she
 won't change once she has said..."  "And Mamma pressed her!" said Nicholas repro
achfully.  "Yes," said Natasha. "Do you know, Nicholasdon't be angrybut I know yo
u will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but I know for certain that you w
on't marry her."  "Now you don't know that at all!" said Nicholas. "But I must ta
lk to her. What a darling Sonya is!" he added with a smile.  "Ah, she is indeed a
 darling! I'll send her to you."  And Natasha kissed her brother and ran away.  A
 minute later Sonya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared look. Nicholas 
went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the first time since his return that
 they had talked alone and about their love.  "Sophie," he began, timidly at firs
t and then more and more boldly, "if you wish to refuse one who is not only a bri
lliant and advantageous match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend..."
  Sonya interrupted him.  "I have already refused," she said hurriedly.  "If you 
are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I..."  Sonya again interrupted. She ga
ve him an imploring, frightened look.  "Nicholas, don't tell me that!" she said. 
 "No, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to say it. If yo
u refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth. I love you, and I th
ink I love you more than anyone else...."  "That is enough for me," said Sonya, b
lushing.  "No, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love ag
ain, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship, confidence, and love 
as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does not wish it. In a word, I make no 
promise. And I beg you to consider Dolokhov's offer," he said, articulating his f
riend's name with difficulty.  "Don't say that to me! I want nothing. I love you 
as a brother and always shall, and I want nothing more."  "You are an angel I am 
not worthy of you, but I am afraid of misleading you."  And Nicholas again kissed
 her hand.      CHAPTER XII   Iogel's were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So
 said the mothers as they watched their young people executing their newly learne
d steps, and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they w
ere ready to drop, and so said the grownup young men and women who came to these 
balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyable. That year two m
arriages had come of these balls. The two pretty young Princesses Gorchakov met s
uitors there and were married and so further increased the fame of these dances. 
What distinguished them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the pr
esence of the goodnatured Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according
 to the rules of his art, as he collected the tickets from all his visitors. Ther
e was the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as g
irls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first time.
 With scarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed to be, prettyso rapturous 
were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes. Sometimes the best of the pupils, 
of whom Natasha, who was exceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the pas d
e chale, but at this last ball only the ecossaise, the anglaise, and the mazurka,
 which was just coming into fashion, were danced. Iogel had taken a ballroom in B
ezukhov's house, and the ball, as everyone said, was a great success. There were 
many pretty girls and the Rostov girls were among the prettiest. They were both p
articularly happy and gay. That evening, proud of Dolokhov's proposal, her refusa
l, and her explanation with Nicholas, Sonya twirled about before she left home so
 that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited, and she was transparently radia
nt with impulsive joy.  Natasha no less proud of her first long dress and of bein
g at a real ball was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with pi
nk ribbons.  Natasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She w
as not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever person she 
happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.  "Oh, how delightful it
 is!" she kept saying, running up to Sonya.  Nicholas and Denisov were walking up
 and down, looking with kindly patronage at the dancers.  "How sweet she isshe wi
ll be a weal beauty!" said Denisov.  "Who?"  "Countess Natasha," answered Denisov
.  "And how she dances! What gwace!" he said again after a pause.  "Who are you t
alking about?"  "About your sister," ejaculated Denisov testily.  Rostov smiled. 
 "My dear count, you were one of my best pupilsyou must dance," said little Iogel
 coming up to Nicholas. "Look how many charming young ladies" He turned with the 
same request to Denisov who was also a former pupil of his.  "No, my dear fellow,
 I'll be a wallflower," said Denisov. "Don't you wecollect what bad use I made of
 your lessons?"  "Oh no!" said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. "You were only i
nattentive, but you had talentoh yes, you had talent!"   The band struck up the n
ewly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not refuse Iogel and asked Sonya to dance
. Denisov sat down by the old ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time w
ith his foot, told them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched th
e young people dancing, Iogel with Natasha, his pride and his best pupil, were th
e first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little feet in low shoe
s, Iogel flew first across the hall with Natasha, who, though shy, went on carefu
lly executing her steps. Denisov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with
 his saber in a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was beca
use he would not and not because he could not. In the middle of a figure he becko
ned to Rostov who was passing  "This is not at all the thing," he said. "What sor
t of Polish mazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly."  Knowing that Deniso
v had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly way in which he danced the maz
urka, Nicholas ran up to Natasha  "Go and choose Denisov. He is a real dancer, a 
wonder!" he said.  When it came to Natasha's turn to choose a partner, she rose a
nd, tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran timidly to
 the corner where Denisov sat. She saw that everybody was looking at her and wait
ing. Nicholas saw that Denisov was refusing though he smiled delightedly. He ran 
up to them.  "Please, Vasili Dmitrich," Natasha was saying, "do come!"  "Oh no, l
et me off, Countess," Denisov replied.  "Now then, Vaska," said Nicholas.  "They 
coax me as if I were Vaska the cat!" said Denisov jokingly.  "I'll sing for you a
 whole evening," said Natasha.  "Oh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!" sai
d Denisov, and he unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped
 his partner's hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot, waiting f
or the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was Denisov's short stature no
t noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to be. At the right be
at of the music he looked sideways at his partner with a merry and triumphant air
, suddenly stamped with one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew ro
und the room taking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half acr
oss the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them, 
when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs, he stopped short on
 his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot clanking his spurs, whirled ra
pidly round, and, striking his left heel against his right, flew round again in a
 circle. Natasha guessed what he meant to do, and abandoning herself to him follo
wed his lead hardly knowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with hi
s left, now with his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round hi
m, and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he wo
uld rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath, and then he sud
denly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps. When at last, smartly 
whirling his partner round in front of her chair, he drew up with a click of his 
spurs and bowed to her, Natasha did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eye
s on him in amazement, smiling as if she did not recognize him.  "What does this 
mean?" she brought out.  Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real m
azurka, everyone was delighted with Denisov's skill, he was asked again and again
 as a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the good 
old days. Denisov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself with his handker
chief, sat down by Natasha and did not leave her for the rest of the evening.    
  CHAPTER XIII   For two days after that Rostov did not see Dolokhov at his own o
r at Dolokhov's home on the third day he received a note from him   As I do not i
ntend to be at your house again for reasons you know of, and am going to rejoin m
y regiment, I am giving a farewell supper tonight to my friendscome to the Englis
h Hotel.   About ten o'clock Rostov went to the English Hotel straight from the t
heater, where he had been with his family and Denisov. He was at once shown to th
e best room, which Dolokhov had taken for that evening. Some twenty men were gath
ered round a table at which Dolokhov sat between two candles. On the table was a 
pile of gold and paper money, and he was keeping the bank. Rostov had not seen hi
m since his proposal and Sonya's refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of
 how they would meet.  Dolokhov's clear, cold glance met Rostov as soon as he ent
ered the door, as though he had long expected him.  "It's a long time since we me
t," he said. "Thanks for coming. I'll just finish dealing, and then Ilyushka will
 come with his chorus."  "I called once or twice at your house," said Rostov, red
dening.  Dolokhov made no reply.  "You may punt," he said.  Rostov recalled at th
at moment a strange conversation he had once had with Dolokhov. "None but fools t
rust to luck in play," Dolokhov had then said.  "Or are you afraid to play with m
e?" Dolokhov now asked as if guessing Rostov's thought.  Beneath his smile Rostov
 saw in him the mood he had shown at the Club dinner and at other times, when as 
if tired of everyday life he had felt a need to escape from it by some strange, a
nd usually cruel, action.  Rostov felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find
 some joke with which to reply to Dolokhov's words. But before he had thought of 
anything, Dolokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and deliberately so
 that everyone could hear  "Do you remember we had a talk about cards... 'He's a 
fool who trusts to luck, one should make certain,' and I want to try."  "To try h
is luck or the certainty?" Rostov asked himself.  "Well, you'd better not play," 
Dolokhov added, and springing a new pack of cards said "Bank, gentlemen!"  Moving
 the money forward he prepared to deal. Rostov sat down by his side and at first 
did not play. Dolokhov kept glancing at him.  "Why don't you play?" he asked.  An
d strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a card, putting a
 small stake on it, and beginning to play.  "I have no money with me," he said.  
"I'll trust you."  Rostov staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, an
d again lost. Dolokhov "killed," that is, beat, ten cards of Rostov's running.  "
Gentlemen," said Dolokhov after he had dealt for some time. "Please place your mo
ney on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning."  One of the players said
 he hoped he might be trusted.  "Yes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the a
ccounts mixed. So I ask you to put the money on your cards," replied Dolokhov. "D
on't stint yourself, we'll settle afterwards," he added, turning to Rostov.  The 
game continued a waiter kept handing round champagne.  All Rostov's cards were be
aten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up against him. He wrote "800 rubles"
 on a card, but while the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered
 it to his usual stake of twenty rubles.  "Leave it," said Dolokhov, though he di
d not seem to be even looking at Rostov, "you'll win it back all the sooner. I lo
se to the others but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?" he asked again.  Ros
tov submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven of hearts wi
th a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He well remembered that 
seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts, on which with a broken bit of
 chalk he had written "800 rubles" in clear upright figures he emptied the glass 
of warm champagne that was handed him, smiled at Dolokhov's words, and with a sin
king heart, waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at Dolokhov's hands which held 
the pack. Much depended on Rostov's winning or losing on that seven of hearts. On
 the previous Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles, and tho
ugh he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told Nicholas that this
 was all he could let him have till May, and asked him to be more economical this
 time. Nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he
 gave his word of honor not to take anything more till the spring. Now only twelv
e hundred rubles was left of that money, so that this seven of hearts meant for h
im not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back o
n his word. With a sinking heart he watched Dolokhov's hands and thought, "Now th
en, make haste and let me have this card and I'll take my cap and drive home to s
upper with Denisov, Natasha, and Sonya, and will certainly never touch a card aga
in." At that moment his home life, jokes with Petya, talks with Sonya, duets with
 Natasha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable bed in the house on th
e Povarskaya rose before him with such vividness, clearness, and charm that it se
emed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not co
nceive that a stupid chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than 
to the left, might deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly
 illumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery. That 
could not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of Dolokhov's hand
s. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuf
fs, laid down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.  "So 
you are not afraid to play with me?" repeated Dolokhov, and as if about to tell a
 good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his chair, and began deliberate
ly with a smile  "Yes, gentlemen, I've been told there's a rumor going about Mosc
ow that I'm a sharper, so I advise you to be careful."  "Come now, deal!" exclaim
ed Rostov.  "Oh, those Moscow gossips!" said Dolokhov, and he took up the cards w
ith a smile.  "Aah!" Rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The s
even he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had lost more 
than he could pay.  "Still, don't ruin yourself!" said Dolokhov with a side glanc
e at Rostov as he continued to deal.      CHAPTER XIV   An hour and a half later 
most of the players were but little interested in their own play.  The whole inte
rest was concentrated on Rostov. Instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had a long 
column of figures scored against him, which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, b
ut that now, as he vaguely supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In real
ity it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles. Dolokhov was no longer listening 
to stories or telling them, but followed every movement of Rostov's hands and occ
asionally ran his eyes over the score against him. He had decided to play until t
hat score reached fortythree thousand. He had fixed on that number because fortyt
hree was the sum of his and Sonya's joint ages. Rostov, leaning his head on both 
hands, sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wi
ne, and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him that tho
se broadboned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt sleeve
s, those hands which he loved and hated, held him in their power.  "Six hundred r
ubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back's impossible... Oh, how pleasant 
it was at home!... The knave, double or quits... it can't be!... And why is he do
ing this to me?" Rostov pondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but Dolokhov r
efused to accept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and a
t one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over t
he Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled
 heap under the table would save him, now counted the cords on his coat and took 
a card with that number and tried staking the total of his losses on it, then he 
looked round for aid from the other players, or peered at the now cold face of Do
lokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind.  "He knows of course what 
this loss means to me. He can't want my ruin. Wasn't he my friend? Wasn't I fond 
of him? But it's not his fault. What's he to do if he has such luck?... And it's 
not my fault either," he thought to himself, "I have done nothing wrong. Have I k
illed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible misfortun
e? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to this table with the t
hought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma's name day and th
en going home. I was so happy, so free, so lighthearted! And I did not realize ho
w happy I was! When did that end and when did this new, terrible state of things 
begin? What marked the change? I sat all the time in this same place at this tabl
e, chose and placed cards, and watched those broadboned agile hands in the same w
ay. When did it happen and what has happened? I am well and strong and still the 
same and in the same place. No, it can't be! Surely it will all end in nothing!" 
 He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot. His face
 was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless efforts to seem ca
lm.  The score against him reached the fateful sum of fortythree thousand. Rostov
 had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he meant to double the 
three thousand just put down to his score, when Dolokhov, slamming down the pack 
of cards, put it aside and began rapidly adding up the total of Rostov's debt, br
eaking the chalk as he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.  "Supper, it's
 time for supper! And here are the gypsies!"  Some swarthy men and women were rea
lly entering from the cold outside and saying something in their gypsy accents. N
icholas understood that it was all over but he said in an indifferent tone  "Well
, won't you go on? I had a splendid card all ready," as if it were the fun of the
 game which interested him most.  "It's all up! I'm lost!" thought he. "Now a bul
let through my brainthat's all that's left me!" And at the same time he said in a
 cheerful voice  "Come now, just this one more little card!"  "All right!" said D
olokhov, having finished the addition. "All right! Twentyone rubles," he said, po
inting to the figure twentyone by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty
three thousand and taking up a pack he prepared to deal. Rostov submissively unbe
nt the corner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended, caref
ully wrote twentyone.  "It's all the same to me," he said. "I only want to see wh
ether you will let me win this ten, or beat it."  Dolokhov began to deal seriousl
y. Oh, how Rostov detested at that moment those hands with their short reddish fi
ngers and hairy wrists, which held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.  "
You owe fortythree thousand, Count," said Dolokhov, and stretching himself he ros
e from the table. "One does get tired sitting so long," he added.  "Yes, I'm tire
d too," said Rostov.  Dolokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not
 for him to jest.  "When am I to receive the money, Count?"  Rostov, flushing, dr
ew Dolokhov into the next room.  "I cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take 
an I.O.U.?" he said.  "I say, Rostov," said Dolokhov clearly, smiling and looking
 Nicholas straight in the eyes, "you know the saying, 'Lucky in love, unlucky at 
cards.' Your cousin is in love with you, I know."  "Oh, it's terrible to feel one
self so in this man's power," thought Rostov. He knew what a shock he would infli
ct on his father and mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it wo
uld be to escape it all, and felt that Dolokhov knew that he could save him from 
all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a m
ouse.  "Your cousin..." Dolokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted him.  "
My cousin has nothing to do with this and it's not necessary to mention her!" he 
exclaimed fiercely.  "Then when am I to have it?"  "Tomorrow," replied Rostov and
 left the room.      CHAPTER XV   To say "tomorrow" and keep up a dignified tone 
was not difficult, but to go home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and fa
ther, confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor
, was terrible.  At home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after r
eturning from the theater, had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord. 
As soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of love wh
ich pervaded the Rostov household that winter and, now after Dolokhov's proposal 
and Iogel's ball, seemed to have grown thicker round Sonya and Natasha as the air
 does before a thunderstorm. Sonya and Natasha, in the lightblue dresses they had
 worn at the theater, looking pretty and conscious of it, were standing by the cl
avichord, happy and smiling. Vera was playing chess with Shinshin in the drawing 
room. The old countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son, sat playin
g patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house. Denisov, with spark
ling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord striking chords with his short 
fingers, his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang, with his small, hu
sky, but true voice, some verses called "Enchantress," which he had composed, and
 to which he was trying to fit music     Enchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre   
 What magic power is this recalls me still?    What spark has set my inmost soul 
on fire,    What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?  He was singing in p
assionate tones, gazing with his sparkling blackagate eyes at the frightened and 
happy Natasha.  "Splendid! Excellent!" exclaimed Natasha. "Another verse," she sa
id, without noticing Nicholas.  "Everything's still the same with them," thought 
Nicholas, glancing into the drawing room, where he saw Vera and his mother with t
he old lady.  "Ah, and here's Nicholas!" cried Natasha, running up to him.  "Is P
apa at home?" he asked.  "I am so glad you've come!" said Natasha, without answer
ing him. "We are enjoying ourselves! Vasili Dmitrich is staying a day longer for 
my sake! Did you know?"  "No, Papa is not back yet," said Sonya.  "Nicholas, have
 you come? Come here, dear!" called the old countess from the drawing room.  Nich
olas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently at her table began t
o watch her hands arranging the cards. From the dancing room, they still heard th
e laughter and merry voices trying to persuade Natasha to sing.  "All wight! All 
wight!" shouted Denisov. "It's no good making excuses now! It's your turn to sing
 the ba'cawollaI entweat you!"  The countess glanced at her silent son.  "What is
 the matter?" she asked.  "Oh, nothing," said he, as if weary of being continuall
y asked the same question. "Will Papa be back soon?"  "I expect so."  "Everything
's the same with them. They know nothing about it! Where am I to go?" thought Nic
holas, and went again into the dancing room where the clavichord stood.  Sonya wa
s sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to Denisov's favorite barcarolle
. Natasha was preparing to sing. Denisov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.
  Nicholas began pacing up and down the room.  "Why do they want to make her sing
? How can she sing? There's nothing to be happy about!" thought he.  Sonya struck
 the first chord of the prelude.  "My God, I'm a ruined and dishonored man! A bul
let through my brain is the only thing left menot singing!" his thoughts ran on. 
"Go away? But where to? It's onelet them sing!"  He continued to pace the room, l
ooking gloomily at Denisov and the girls and avoiding their eyes.  "Nikolenka, wh
at is the matter?" Sonya's eyes fixed on him seemed to ask. She noticed at once t
hat something had happened to him.  Nicholas turned away from her. Natasha too, w
ith her quick instinct, had instantly noticed her brother's condition. But, thoug
h she noticed it, she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far fro
m sorrow, sadness, or selfreproach, that she purposely deceived herself as young 
people often do. "No, I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with a
nyone's sorrow," she felt, and she said to herself "No, I must be mistaken, he mu
st be feeling happy, just as I am."  "Now, Sonya!" she said, going to the very mi
ddle of the room, where she considered the resonance was best.  Having lifted her
 head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet dancers do, Natasha, rising en
ergetically from her heels to her toes, stepped to the middle of the room and sto
od still.  "Yes, that's me!" she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with whic
h Denisov followed her.  "And what is she so pleased about?" thought Nicholas, lo
oking at his sister. "Why isn't she dull and ashamed?"  Natasha took the first no
te, her throat swelled, her chest rose, her eyes became serious. At that moment s
he was oblivious of her surroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds whi
ch anyone may produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which
 leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill you and m
ake you weep.  Natasha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing serious
ly, mainly because Denisov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang as a c
hild, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish, painstaking effe
ct that had been in it before but she did not yet sing well, as all the connoisse
urs who heard her said "It is not trained, but it is a beautiful voice that must 
be trained." Only they generally said this some time after she had finished singi
ng. While that untrained voice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transiti
ons, was sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in it a
nd wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a virginal freshness, an uncon
sciousness of her own powers, and an as yet untrained velvety softness, which so 
mingled with her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in that voic
e could be altered without spoiling it.  "What is this?" thought Nicholas, listen
ing to her with widely opened eyes. "What has happened to her? How she is singing
 today!" And suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the nex
t note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into three beats
 "Oh mio crudele affetto."... One, two, three... one, two, three... One... "Oh mi
o crudele affetto."... One, two, three... One. "Oh, this senseless life of ours!"
 thought Nicholas. "All this misery, and money, and Dolokhov, and anger, and hono
rit's all nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Natasha, now then, dearest! 
Now then, darling! How will she take that si? She's taken it! Thank God!" And wit
hout noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si he sung a second, a third
 below the high note. "Ah, God! How fine! Did I really take it? How fortunate!" h
e thought.  Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was fin
est in Rostov's soul! And this something was apart from everything else in the wo
rld and above everything in the world. "What were losses, and Dolokhov, and words
 of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob and yet be happy..."      CHAP
TER XVI   It was long since Rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he did t
hat day. But no sooner had Natasha finished her barcarolle than reality again pre
sented itself. He got up without saying a word and went downstairs to his own roo
m. A quarter of an hour later the old count came in from his Club, cheerful and c
ontented. Nicholas, hearing him drive up, went to meet him.  "Wellhad a good time
?" said the old count, smiling gaily and proudly at his son.  Nicholas tried to s
ay "Yes," but could not and he nearly burst into sobs. The count was lighting his
 pipe and did not notice his son's condition.  "Ah, it can't be avoided!" thought
 Nicholas, for the first and last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, wh
ich made him feel ashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to 
let him have the carriage to drive to town  "Papa, I have come on a matter of bus
iness. I was nearly forgetting. I need some money."  "Dear me!" said his father, 
who was in a specially good humor. "I told you it would not be enough. How much?"
  "Very much," said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless smile, for whic
h he was long unable to forgive himself, "I have lost a little, I mean a good dea
l, a great dealforty three thousand."  "What! To whom?... Nonsense!" cried the co
unt, suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people
 do.  "I promised to pay tomorrow," said Nicholas.  "Well!..." said the old count
, spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa.  "It can't be helped
 It happens to everyone!" said the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while i
n his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could no
t atone for his crime. He longed to kiss his father's hands and kneel to beg his 
forgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to ever
yone!  The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son's words and began bust
lingly searching for something.  "Yes, yes," he muttered, "it will be difficult, 
I fear, difficult to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?"  A
nd with a furtive glance at his son's face, the count went out of the room.... Ni
cholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all expected this.  "Papa
! Papa!" he called after him, sobbing, "forgive me!" And seizing his father's han
d, he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears.  While father and son were hav
ing their explanation, the mother and daughter were having one not less important
. Natasha came running to her mother, quite excited.  "Mamma!... Mamma!... He has
 made me..."  "Made what?"  "Made, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!" she exclaimed
.  The countess did not believe her ears. Denisov had proposed. To whom? To this 
chit of a girl, Natasha, who not so long ago was playing with dolls and who was s
till having lessons.  "Don't, Natasha! What nonsense!" she said, hoping it was a 
joke.  "Nonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact," said Natasha indignantly. "
I come to ask you what to do, and you call it 'nonsense!'"  The countess shrugged
 her shoulders.  "If it is true that Monsieur Denisov has made you a proposal, te
ll him he is a fool, that's all!"  "No, he's not a fool!" replied Natasha indigna
ntly and seriously.  "Well then, what do you want? You're all in love nowadays. W
ell, if you are in love, marry him!" said the countess, with a laugh of annoyance
. "Good luck to you!"  "No, Mamma, I'm not in love with him, I suppose I'm not in
 love with him."  "Well then, tell him so."  "Mamma, are you cross? Don't be cros
s, dear! Is it my fault?"  "No, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and
 tell him?" said the countess smiling.  "No, I will do it myself, only tell me wh
at to say. It's all very well for you," said Natasha, with a responsive smile. "Y
ou should have seen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came
 out accidently."  "Well, all the same, you must refuse him."  "No, I mustn't. I 
am so sorry for him! He's so nice."  "Well then, accept his offer. It's high time
 for you to be married," answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.  "No, M
amma, but I'm so sorry for him. I don't know how I'm to say it."  "And there's no
thing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself," said the countess, indignant 
that they should have dared to treat this little Natasha as grown up.  "No, not o
n any account! I will tell him myself, and you'll listen at the door," and Natash
a ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall, where Denisov was sitting on t
he same chair by the clavichord with his face in his hands.  He jumped up at the 
sound of her light step.  "Nataly," he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, 
"decide my fate. It is in your hands."  "Vasili Dmitrich, I'm so sorry for you!..
. No, but you are so nice... but it won't do...not that... but as a friend, I sha
ll always love you."  Denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she
 did not understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they
 heard the quick rustle of the countess' dress. She came up to them.  "Vasili Dmi
trich, I thank you for the honor," she said, with an embarrassed voice, though it
 sounded severe to Denisov"but my daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my
 son's friend, you would have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you wo
uld not have obliged me to give this refusal."  "Countess..." said Denisov, with 
downcast eyes and a guilty face. He tried to say more, but faltered.  Natasha cou
ld not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She began to sob aloud.  "Counte
ss, I have done w'ong," Denisov went on in an unsteady voice, "but believe me, I 
so adore your daughter and all your family that I would give my life twice over..
." He looked at the countess, and seeing her severe face said "Well, goodby, Coun
tess," and kissing her hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, withou
t looking at Natasha.   Next day Rostov saw Denisov off. He did not wish to stay 
another day in Moscow. All Denisov's Moscow friends gave him a farewell entertain
ment at the gypsies', with the result that he had no recollection of how he was p
ut in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey.  After Denisov's de
parture, Rostov spent another fortnight in Moscow, without going out of the house
, waiting for the money his father could not at once raise, and he spent most of 
his time in the girls' room.  Sonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever.
 It was as if she wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that mad
e her love him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of her.
  He filled the girls' albums with verses and music, and having at last sent Dolo
khov the whole fortythree thousand rubles and received his receipt, he left at th
e end of November, without taking leave of any of his acquaintances, to overtake 
his regiment which was already in Poland.      BOOK FIVE 1806  07      CHAPTER I 
  After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the Torzhok po
st station, either there were no horses or the postmaster would not supply them. 
Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing, he lay down on the leather sofa i
n front of a round table, put his big feet in their overboots on the table, and b
egan to reflect.  "Will you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready
, and tea?" asked his valet.  Pierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw
 anything. He had begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on t
he same questionone so important that he took no notice of what went on around hi
m. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to Petersburg earlier or late
r, or whether he secured accommodation at this station, but compared to the thoug
hts that now occupied him it was a matter of indifference whether he remained the
re for a few hours or for the rest of his life.  The postmaster, his wife, the va
let, and a peasant woman selling Torzhok embroidery came into the room offering t
heir services. Without changing his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over
 his spectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go on liv
ing without having solved the problems that so absorbed him. He had been engrosse
d by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from Sokolniki after the du
el and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless night. But now, in the solitude 
of the journey, they seized him with special force. No matter what he thought abo
ut, he always returned to these same questions which he could not solve and yet c
ould not cease to ask himself. It was as if the thread of the chief screw which h
eld his life together were stripped, so that the screw could not get in or out, b
ut went on turning uselessly in the same place.  The postmaster came in and began
 obsequiously to beg his excellency to wait only two hours, when, come what might
, he would let his excellency have the courier horses. It was plain that he was l
ying and only wanted to get more money from the traveler.  "Is this good or bad?"
 Pierre asked himself. "It is good for me, bad for another traveler, and for hims
elf it's unavoidable, because he needs money for food the man said an officer had
 once given him a thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horse
s. But the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible. 
And I," continued Pierre, "shot Dolokhov because I considered myself injured, and
 Louis XVI was executed because they considered him a criminal, and a year later 
they executed those who executed himalso for some reason. What is bad? What is go
od? What should one love and what hate? What does one live for? And what am I? Wh
at is life, and what is death? What power governs all?"  There was no answer to a
ny of these questions, except one, and that not a logical answer and not at all a
 reply to them. The answer was "You'll die and all will end. You'll die and know 
all, or cease asking." But dying was also dreadful.  The Torzhok peddler woman, i
n a whining voice, went on offering her wares, especially a pair of goatskin slip
pers. "I have hundreds of rubles I don't know what to do with, and she stands in 
her tattered cloak looking timidly at me," he thought. "And what does she want th
e money for? As if that money could add a hair's breadth to happiness or peace of
 mind. Can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and death?dea
th which ends all and must come today or tomorrowat any rate, in an instant as co
mpared with eternity." And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread, a
nd again it turned uselessly in the same place.  His servant handed him a halfcut
 novel, in the form of letters, by Madame de Souza. He began reading about the su
fferings and virtuous struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. "And why did she
 resist her seducer when she loved him?" he thought. "God could not have put into
 her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wifeas she once wasdid not st
ruggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been found out, nothing discovered
," Pierre again said to himself. "All we can know is that we know nothing. And th
at's the height of human wisdom."  Everything within and around him seemed confus
ed, senseless, and repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstance
s Pierre found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.  "I make bold to ask your exce
llency to move a little for this gentleman," said the postmaster, entering the ro
om followed by another traveler, also detained for lack of horses.  The newcomer 
was a short, largeboned, yellowfaced, wrinkled old man, with gray bushy eyebrows 
overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish color.  Pierre took his feet off
 the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that had been got ready for him, glan
cing now and then at the newcomer, who, with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily
 taking off his wraps with the aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. Wit
h a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeencover
ed, sheepskin coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head w
ith its broad temples and closecropped hair, and looked at Bezukhov. The stern, s
hrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to s
peak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a questi
on about the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His shriveled old hands wer
e folded and on the finger of one of them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring w
ith a seal representing a death's head. The stranger sat without stirring, either
 resting or, as it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His se
rvant was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache, evidently n
ot because he was shaven but because they had never grown. This active old servan
t was unpacking the traveler's canteen and preparing tea. He brought in a boiling
 samovar. When everything was ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the t
able, filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to 
whom he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the need, even
 the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this stranger.  The servan
t brought back his tumbler turned upside down, * with an unfinished bit of nibble
d sugar, and asked if anything more would be wanted.       * To indicate he did n
ot want more tea.   "No. Give me the book," said the stranger.  The servant hande
d him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work, and the traveler became a
bsorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at once the stranger closed the book, pu
tting in a marker, and again, leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat 
in his former position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time 
to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and severe gaze
 straight on Pierre's face.  Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, 
but the bright old eyes attracted him irresistibly.      CHAPTER II   "I have the
 pleasure of addressing Count Bezukhov, if I am not mistaken," said the stranger 
in a deliberate and loud voice.  Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him ov
er his spectacles.  "I have heard of you, my dear sir," continued the stranger, "
and of your misfortune." He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to say"Yes, 
misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what happened to you in Moscow w
as a misfortune.""I regret it very much, my dear sir."  Pierre flushed and, hurri
edly putting his legs down from the bed, bent forward toward the old man with a f
orced and timid smile.  "I have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear si
r, but for greater reasons."  He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved asid
e on the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt
 reluctant to enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him i
nvoluntarily, came up and sat down beside him.  "You are unhappy, my dear sir," t
he stranger continued. "You are young and I am old. I should like to help you as 
far as lies in my power."  "Oh, yes!" said Pierre, with a forced smile. "I am ver
y grateful to you. Where are you traveling from?"  The stranger's face was not ge
nial, it was even cold and severe, but in spite of this, both the face and words 
of his new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to Pierre.  "But if for reas
on you don't feel inclined to talk to me," said the old man, "say so, my dear sir
." And he suddenly smiled, in an unexpected and tenderly paternal way.  "Oh no, n
ot at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your acquaintance," said Pierr
e. And again, glancing at the stranger's hands, he looked more closely at the rin
g, with its skulla Masonic sign.  "Allow me to ask," he said, "are you a Mason?" 
 "Yes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons," said the stranger, looking
 deeper and deeper into Pierre's eyes. "And in their name and my own I hold out a
 brotherly hand to you."  "I am afraid," said Pierre, smiling, and wavering betwe
en the confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own ha
bit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs"I am afraid I am very far from understandin
ghow am I to put it?I am afraid my way of looking at the world is so opposed to y
ours that we shall not understand one another."  "I know your outlook," said the 
Mason, "and the view of life you mention, and which you think is the result of yo
ur own mental efforts, is the one held by the majority of people, and is the inva
riable fruit of pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if 
I had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a regret
table delusion."  "Just as I may suppose you to be deluded," said Pierre, with a 
faint smile.  "I should never dare to say that I know the truth," said the Mason,
 whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness. "No one
 can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying stone on stone with the cooperati
on of all, by the millions of generations from our forefather Adam to our own tim
es, is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the Great God
," he added, and closed his eyes.  "I ought to tell you that I do not believe... 
do not believe in God," said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it e
ssential to speak the whole truth.  The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smile
d as a rich man with millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him t
hat he, poor man, had not the five rubles that would make him happy.  "Yes, you d
o not know Him, my dear sir," said the Mason. "You cannot know Him. You do not kn
ow Him and that is why you are unhappy."  "Yes, yes, I am unhappy," assented Pier
re. "But what am I to do?"  "You know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very u
nhappy. You do not know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He i
s in thee, and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!" pronounce
d the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.  He paused and sighed, evidently tryi
ng to calm himself.  "If He were not," he said quietly, "you and I would not be s
peaking of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom hast thou de
nied?" he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his voice. "Who
 invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came thy conception of the existence o
f such an incomprehensible Being? didst thou, and why did the whole world, concei
ve the idea of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being allpowerf
ul, eternal, and infinite in all His attributes?..."  He stopped and remained sil
ent for a long time.  Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.  "
He exists, but to understand Him is hard," the Mason began again, looking not at 
Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves of his book with his old h
ands which from excitement he could not keep still. "If it were a man whose exist
ence thou didst doubt I could bring him to thee, could take him by the hand and s
how him to thee. But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, Hi
s infinity, and all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he 
may not see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness and 
sinfulness?" He paused again. "Who art thou? Thou dreamest that thou art wise bec
ause thou couldst utter those blasphemous words," he went on, with a somber and s
cornful smile. "And thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little child, w
ho, playing with the parts of a skillfully made watch, dares to say that, as he d
oes not understand its use, he does not believe in the master who made it. To kno
w Him is hard.... For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to 
attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim but in our lack o
f understanding we see only our weakness and His greatness...."  Pierre listened 
with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason's face with shining eyes, not interrup
ting or questioning him, but believing with his whole soul what the stranger said
. Whether he accepted the wise reasoning contained in the Mason's words, or belie
ved as a child believes, in the speaker's tone of conviction and earnestness, or 
the tremor of the speaker's voicewhich sometimes almost brokeor those brilliant a
ged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm firmness and certainty of his 
vocation, which radiated from his whole being and which struck Pierre especially 
by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessnessat any rate, Pierre longed wit
h his whole soul to believe and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfor
t, regeneration, and return to life.  "He is not to be apprehended by reason, but
 by life," said the Mason.  "I do not understand," said Pierre, feeling with dism
ay doubts reawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in t
he Mason's arguments he dreaded not to be able to believe in him. "I don't unders
tand," he said, "how it is that the mind of man cannot attain the knowledge of wh
ich you speak."  The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.  "The highest w
isdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to imbibe," he said. "Can 
I receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel and judge of its purity? Only by
 the inner purification of myself can I retain in some degree of purity the liqui
d I receive."  "Yes, yes, that is so," said Pierre joyfully.  "The highest wisdom
 is not founded on reason alone, not on those worldly sciences of physics, histor
y, chemistry, and the like, into which intellectual knowledge is divided. The hig
hest wisdom is one. The highest wisdom has but one sciencethe science of the whol
ethe science explaining the whole creation and man's place in it. To receive that
 science it is necessary to purify and renew one's inner self, and so before one 
can know, it is necessary to believe and to perfect one's self. And to attain thi
s end, we have the light called conscience that God has implanted in our souls." 
 "Yes, yes," assented Pierre.  "Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the 
spirit, and ask thyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou att
ained relying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich, you are
 clever, you are well educated. And what have you done with all these good gifts?
 Are you content with yourself and with your life?"  "No, I hate my life," Pierre
 muttered, wincing.  "Thou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself and as thou 
art purified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir. How have you
 spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving everything from society an
d giving nothing in return. You have become the possessor of wealth. How have you
 used it? What have you done for your neighbor? Have you ever thought of your ten
s of thousands of slaves? Have you helped them physically and morally? No! You ha
ve profited by their toil to lead a profligate life. That is what you have done. 
Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your neighbor? No! You
 have spent your life in idleness. Then you married, my dear sirtook on yourself 
responsibility for the guidance of a young woman and what have you done? You have
 not helped her to find the way of truth, my dear sir, but have thrust her into a
n abyss of deceit and misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and you say yo
u do not know God and hate your life. There is nothing strange in that, my dear s
ir!"  After these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, again lean
ed his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre looked at that ag
ed, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face and moved his lips without uttering a
 sound. He wished to say, "Yes, a vile, idle, vicious life!" but dared not break 
the silence.  The Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his
 servant.  "How about the horses?" he asked, without looking at Pierre.  "The exc
hange horses have just come," answered the servant. "Will you not rest here?"  "N
o, tell them to harness."  "Can he really be going away leaving me alone without 
having told me all, and without promising to help me?" thought Pierre, rising wit
h downcast head and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at the Mason
. "Yes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible and profligate life,
 though I did not like it and did not want to," thought Pierre. "But this man kno
ws the truth and, if he wished to, could disclose it to me."  Pierre wished to sa
y this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The traveler, having packed his things 
with his practiced hands, began fastening his coat. When he had finished, he turn
ed to Bezukhov, and said in a tone of indifferent politeness  "Where are you goin
g to now, my dear sir?"  "I?... I'm going to Petersburg," answered Pierre, in a c
hildlike, hesitating voice. "I thank you. I agree with all you have said. But do 
not suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what you would have 
me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it is I, above all, who am t
o blame for everything. Help me, teach me, and perhaps I may..."  Pierre could no
t go on. He gulped and turned away.  The Mason remained silent for a long time, e
vidently considering.  "Help comes from God alone," he said, "but such measure of
 help as our Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to P
etersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski" he took out his notebook and wrote a few
 words on a large sheet of paper folded in four. "Allow me to give you a piece of
 advice. When you reach the capital, first of all devote some time to solitude an
d selfexamination and do not resume your former way of life. And now I wish you a
 good journey, my dear sir," he added, seeing that his servant had entered... "an
d success."  The traveler was Joseph Alexeevich Bazdeev, as Pierre saw from the p
ostmaster's book. Bazdeev had been one of the bestknown Freemasons and Martinists
, even in Novikov's time. For a long while after he had gone, Pierre did not go t
o bed or order horses but paced up and down the room, pondering over his vicious 
past, and with a rapturous sense of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissf
ul, irreproachable, virtuous future that seemed to him so easy. It seemed to him 
that he had been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to 
be virtuous. Not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul. He firmly bel
ieved in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supportin
g one another in the path of virtue, and that is how Freemasonry presented itself
 to him.      CHAPTER III   On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know
 of his arrival, he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas a Kempis,
 whose book had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing he continually realiz
ed as he read that book the joy, hitherto unknown to him, of believing in the pos
sibility of attaining perfection, and in the possibility of active brotherly love
 among men, which Joseph Alexeevich had revealed to him. A week after his arrival
, the young Polish count, Willarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg
 society, came into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner i
n which Dolokhov's second had called on him, and, having closed the door behind h
im and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room, addressed Pierre
.  "I have come to you with a message and an offer, Count," he said without sitti
ng down. "A person of very high standing in our Brotherhood has made application 
for you to be received into our Order before the usual term and has proposed to m
e to be your sponsor. I consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person's wishes
. Do you wish to enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?"  The 
cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before met at balls, am
iably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women, surprised Pierre.  "Yes
, I do wish it," said he.  Willarski bowed his head.  "One more question, Count,"
 he said, "which I beg you to answer in all sinceritynot as a future Mason but as
 an honest man have you renounced your former convictionsdo you believe in God?" 
 Pierre considered.  "Yes... yes, I believe in God," he said.  "In that case..." 
began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.  "Yes, I do believe in God," he repe
ated.  "In that case we can go," said Willarski. "My carriage is at your service.
"  Willarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre's inquiries as to what he
 must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied that brothers more wort
hy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to tell the truth.  Having ent
ered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its headquarters, and hav
ing ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small welllit anteroom where they t
ook off their cloaks without the aid of a servant. From there they passed into an
other room. A man in strange attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping tow
ard him, said something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a sm
all wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen before. H
aving taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound Pierre's eyes with it a
nd tied it in a knot behind, catching some hairs painfully in the knot. Then he d
rew his face down, kissed him, and taking him by the hand led him forward. The ha
irs tied in the knot hurt Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a s
hamefaced smile. His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a puckered, tho
ugh smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.  Having led 
him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.  "Whatever happens to you," he said, "you
 must bear it all manfully if you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood." 
Pierre nodded affirmatively. "When you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover
 your eyes," added Willarski. "I wish you courage and success," and, pressing Pie
rre's hand, he went out.  Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Onc
e or twice he shrugged his and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if wishing to 
take it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent with his eyes bandaged
 seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb, his legs almost gave way, it seemed t
o him that he was tired out. He experienced a variety of most complex sensations.
 He felt afraid of what would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his 
fear. He felt curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed
 to him but most of all, he felt joyful that the moment had come when he would at
 last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively virtuous life of whi
ch he had been dreaming since he met Joseph Alexeevich. Loud knocks were heard at
 the door. Pierre took the bandage off his eyes and glanced around him. The room 
was in black darkness, only a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pier
re went nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open 
book. The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp inside was a hum
an skull with its cavities and teeth. After reading the first words of the Gospel
 "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God," Pierre went round the
 table and saw a large open box filled with something. It was a coffin with bones
 inside. He was not at all surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entire
ly new life quite unlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, even 
more unusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospelit seemed to h
im that he had expected all this and even more. Trying to stimulate his emotions 
he looked around. "God, death, love, the brotherhood of man," he kept saying to h
imself, associating these words with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened and 
someone came in.  By the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed
, he saw rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the darkness
, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the table and placed on i
t his small leathergloved hands.  This short man had on a white leather apron whi
ch covered his chest and part of his legs he had on a kind of necklace above whic
h rose a high white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from 
below.  "For what have you come hither?" asked the newcomer, turning in Pierre's 
direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. "Why have you, who do not believ
e in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light, come here? What do y
ou seek from us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?"  At the moment the door opened a
nd the stranger came in, Pierre felt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had
 experienced in his boyhood at confession he felt himself in the presence of one 
socially a complete stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. W
ith bated breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor by which name the b
rother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was known. Drawing
 nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew, Smolyaninov, and it mortified
 him to think that the newcomer was an acquaintancehe wished him simply a brother
 and a virtuous instructor. For a long time he could not utter a word, so that th
e Rhetor had to repeat his question.  "Yes... I... I... desire regeneration," Pie
rre uttered with difficulty.  "Very well," said Smolyaninov, and went on at once 
"Have you any idea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach yo
ur aim?" said he quietly and quickly.  "I... hope... for guidance... help... in r
egeneration," said Pierre, with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utteranc
e due to his excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in
 Russian.  "What is your conception of Freemasonry?"  "I imagine that Freemasonry
 is the fraternity and equality of men who have virtuous aims," said Pierre, feel
ing ashamed of the inadequacy of his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he
 spoke. "I imagine..."  "Good!" said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied wit
h this answer. "Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?"  "N
o, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it," said Pierre, so softly that 
the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying. "I have been an ath
eist," answered Pierre.  "You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws i
n your life, therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?" said the Rhet
or, after a moment's pause.  "Yes, yes," assented Pierre.  The Rhetor cleared his
 throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast, and began to speak.  "Now I must
 disclose to you the chief aim of our Order," he said, "and if this aim coincides
 with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood with profit. The first and chief objec
t of our Order, the foundation on which it rests and which no human power can des
troy, is the preservation and handing on to posterity of a certain important myst
ery... which has come down to us from the remotest ages, even from the first mana
 mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this mystery is 
of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and
 diligent selfpurification, not everyone can hope to attain it quickly. Hence we 
have a secondary aim, that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform
 their hearts, to purify and enlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by t
radition from those who have striven to attain this mystery, and thereby to rende
r them capable of receiving it.  "By purifying and regenerating our members we tr
y, thirdly, to improve the whole human race, offering it in our members an exampl
e of piety and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil whic
h sways the world. Think this over and I will come to you again."  "To combat the
 evil which sways the world..." Pierre repeated, and a mental image of his future
 activity in this direction rose in his mind. He imagined men such as he had hims
elf been a fortnight ago, and he addressed an edifying exhortation to them. He im
agined to himself vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and
 deed, imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three objects me
ntioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind, especially appealed 
to Pierre. The important mystery mentioned by the Rhetor, though it aroused his c
uriosity, did not seem to him essential, and the second aim, that of purifying an
d regenerating himself, did not much interest him because at that moment he felt 
with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was rea
dy for all that was good.  Half an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the 
seeker of the seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon's temple
, which every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These virtues were 1. Discre
tion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. Obedience to those of higher ra
nks in the Order.  3. Morality.  4. Love of mankind. 5. Courage. 6. Generosity. 7
. The love of death.  "In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of deat
h," the Rhetor said, "to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but as
 a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this distr
essful life, and leads it to its place of recompense and peace."  "Yes, that must
 be so," thought Pierre, when after these words the Rhetor went away, leaving him
 to solitary meditation. "It must be so, but I am still so weak that I love my li
fe, the meaning of which is only now gradually opening before me." But five of th
e other virtues which Pierre recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt alre
ady in his soul courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind, and especially ob
ediencewhich did not even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. He now felt so glad to
 be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will to those who knew the in
dubitable truth. He forgot what the seventh virtue was and could not recall it.  
The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre whether he was 
still firm in his intention and determined to submit to all that would be require
d of him.  "I am ready for everything," said Pierre.  "I must also inform you," s
aid the Rhetor, "that our Order delivers its teaching not in words only but also 
by other means, which may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker af
ter wisdom and virtue than mere words. This chamber with what you see therein sho
uld already have suggested to your heart, if it is sincere, more than words could
 do. You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method of enligh
tenment. Our Order imitates the ancient societies that explained their teaching b
y hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph," said the Rhetor, "is an emblem of something not c
ognizable by the senses but which possesses qualities resembling those of the sym
bol."  Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He liste
ned to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his ordeal was about 
to begin.  "If you are resolved, I must begin your initiation," said the Rhetor c
oming closer to Pierre. "In token of generosity I ask you to give me all your val
uables."  "But I have nothing here," replied Pierre, supposing that he was asked 
to give up all he possessed.  "What you have with you watch, money, rings...."  P
ierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage for some time to
 get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that had been done, the Rhetor sai
d  "In token of obedience, I ask you to undress."  Pierre took off his coat, wais
tcoat, and left boot according to the Rhetor's instructions. The Mason drew the s
hirt back from Pierre's left breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of 
his trousers to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot 
also and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the tro
uble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him a slipper for hi
s left foot. With a childlike smile of embarrassment, doubt, and selfderision, wh
ich appeared on his face against his will, Pierre stood with his arms hanging dow
n and legs apart, before his brother Rhetor, and awaited his further commands.  "
And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief passion," said 
the latter.  "My passion! I have had so many," replied Pierre.  "That passion whi
ch more than all others caused you to waver on the path of virtue," said the Maso
n.  Pierre paused, seeking a reply.  "Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritab
ility? Anger? Women?" He went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of
 them to give the preeminence.  "Women," he said in a low, scarcely audible voice
.  The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this answer. At 
last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that lay on the table, again 
bound his eyes.  "For the last time I say to youturn all your attention upon your
self, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in passion but in yo
ur own heart. The source of blessedness is not without us but within...."  Pierre
 had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source of blessedness w
hich now flooded his heart with glad emotion.      CHAPTER IV   Soon after this t
here came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not the Rhetor but Pierre's spon
sor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his voice. To fresh questions as to the fir
mness of his resolution Pierre replied "Yes, yes, I agree," and with a beaming, c
hildlike smile, his fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and timidly in one sli
ppered and one booted foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his bare
 chest. He was conducted from that room along passages that turned backwards and 
forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the Lodge. Willarski coughed, he
 was answered by the Masonic knock with mallets, the doors opened before them. A 
bass voice Pierre was still blindfolded questioned him as to who he was, when and
 where he was born, and so on. Then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded,
 and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his pilgrimage, of
 holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the universe, and of the courage wi
th which he should endure toils and dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noti
ced that he was spoken of now as the "Seeker," now as the "Sufferer," and now as 
the "Postulant," to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and sword
s. As he was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty 
among his conductors. He heard those around him disputing in whispers and one of 
them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet. After that they took
 his right hand, placed it on something, and told him to hold a pair of compasses
 to his left breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read alou
d an oath of fidelity to the laws of the Order. The candles were then extinguishe
d and some spirit lighted, as Pierre knew by the smell, and he was told that he w
ould now see the lesser light. The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by the fai
nt light of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, saw several men standing b
efore him, wearing aprons like the Rhetor's and holding swords in their hands poi
nted at his breast. Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with blo
od. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the swords, meani
ng them to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once 
blindfolded again.  "Now thou hast seen the lesser light," uttered a voice. Then 
the candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light the banda
ge was again removed and more than ten voices said together "Sic transit gloria m
undi."  Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room an
d at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some twelve men 
in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them Pierre had met in Peters
burg society. In the President's chair sat a young man he did not know, with a pe
culiar cross hanging from his neck. On his right sat the Italian abbe whom Pierre
 had met at Anna Pavlovna's two years before. There were also present a very dist
inguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kuragins'. All
 maintained a solemn silence, listening to the words of the President, who held a
 mallet in his hand. Let into the wall was a starshaped light. At one side of the
 table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon it, at the other was s
omething resembling an altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it stood
 seven large candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the brothers led Pi
erre up to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and bade him lie down, say
ing that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple.  "He must first re
ceive the trowel," whispered one of the brothers.  "Oh, hush, please!" said anoth
er.  Pierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without obeying, 
and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. "Where am I? What am I doing? Aren't they 
laughing at me? Shan't I be ashamed to remember this?" But these doubts only last
ed a moment. Pierre glanced at the serious faces of those around, remembered all 
he had already gone through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was 
aghast at his hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling, pro
strated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the feeling of devoti
on returned to him even more strongly than before. When he had lain there some ti
me, he was told to get up, and a white leather apron, such as the others wore, wa
s put on him he was given a trowel and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand 
Master addressed him. He told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the w
hiteness of that apron, which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplai
ned trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice, and i
ndulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor. As to the first pair of g
loves, a man's, he said that Pierre could not know their meaning but must keep th
em. The second pair of man's gloves he was to wear at the meetings, and finally o
f the third, a pair of women's gloves, he said "Dear brother, these woman's glove
s are intended for you too. Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of a
ll. This gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to 
be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry." And after a pause, he added "But beware, dea
r brother, that these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean." While the Grand
 Master said these last words it seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierr
e himself grew still more confused, blushed like a child till tears came to his e
yes, began looking about him uneasily, and an awkward pause followed.  This silen
ce was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the rug and began read
ing to him from a manuscript book an explanation of all the figures on it the sun
, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, 
a pillar, three windows, and so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was s
hown the signs of the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit 
down. The Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very long, and Pierr
e, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to understand what 
was being read. He managed to follow only the last words of the statutes and thes
e remained in his mind.  "In our temples we recognize no other distinctions," rea
d the Grand Master, "but those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any dist
inctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother's aid whoever he may be, e
xhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth, never bear malice or enmity t
oward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous. Kindle in all hearts the flame of vir
tue. Share thy happiness with thy neighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of 
that bliss. Forgive thy enemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Th
us fulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity whi
ch thou hast lost."  He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who
, with tears of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the 
congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides. He ac
knowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only brothers, and burned wi
th impatience to set to work with them.  The Grand Master rapped with his mallet.
 All the Masons sat down in their places, and one of them read an exhortation on 
the necessity of humility.  The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should b
e performed, and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of "Collector of 
Alms" went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked to subscribe all he
 had, but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same amount as the
 others.  The meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he ha
d returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had become 
completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits and way of life. 
     CHAPTER V   The day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was si
tting at home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square,
 one side of which symbolized God, another moral things, a third physical things,
 and the fourth a combination of these. Now and then his attention wandered from 
the book and the Square and he formed in imagination a new plan of life. On the p
revious evening at the Lodge, he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached t
he Emperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre propose
d going to his estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his ser
fs. He was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince Vasili suddenly entered t
he room.  "My dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you quarr
eled with Helene, mon cher? You are under a delusion," said Prince Vasili, as he 
entered. "I know all about it, and I can tell you positively that Helene is as in
nocent before you as Christ was before the Jews."  Pierre was about to reply, but
 Prince Vasili interrupted him.  "And why didn't you simply come straight to me a
s to a friend? I know all about it and understand it all," he said. "You behaved 
as becomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won't go into 
that. But consider the position in which you are placing her and me in the eyes o
f society, and even of the court," he added, lowering his voice. "She is living i
n Moscow and you are here. Remember, dear boy," and he drew Pierre's arm downward
s, "it is simply a misunderstanding. I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us wri
te her a letter at once, and she'll come here and all will be explained, or else,
 my dear boy, let me tell you it's quite likely you'll have to suffer for it."  P
rince Vasili gave Pierre a significant look.  "I know from reliable sources that 
the Dowager Empress is taking a keen interest in the whole affair. You know she i
s very gracious to Helene."  Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one han
d, Prince Vasili did not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begi
n to speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly
 resolved to answer his fatherinlaw. Moreover, the words of the Masonic statutes,
 "be kindly and courteous," recurred to him. He blinked, went red, got up and sat
 down again, struggling with himself to do what was for him the most difficult th
ing in lifeto say an unpleasant thing to a man's face, to say what the other, who
ever he might be, did not expect. He was so used to submitting to Prince Vasili's
 tone of careless selfassurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it n
ow, but he also felt that on what he said now his future dependedwhether he would
 follow the same old road, or that new path so attractively shown him by the Maso
ns, on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new life.  "Now, dear boy
," said Prince Vasili playfully, "say 'yes,' and I'll write to her myself, and we
 will kill the fatted calf."  But before Prince Vasili had finished his playful s
peech, Pierre, without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like
 his father, muttered in a whisper  "Prince, I did not ask you here. Go, please g
o!" And he jumped up and opened the door for him.  "Go!" he repeated, amazed at h
imself and glad to see the look of confusion and fear that showed itself on Princ
e Vasili's face.  "What's the matter with you? Are you ill?"  "Go!" the quivering
 voice repeated. And Prince Vasili had to go without receiving any explanation.  
A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons, and leav
ing large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his estates. His new bre
thren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons and promised to write to him
 and guide him in his new activity.      CHAPTER VI   The duel between Pierre and
 Dolokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the Emperor's severity regarding duels a
t that time, neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the st
ory of the duel, confirmed by Pierre's rupture with his wife, was the talk of soc
iety. Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an 
illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia, h
ad sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriagewhen the marriageable 
daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from himespecially as he did not 
know how, and did not wish, to court society's favor. Now he alone was blamed for
 what had happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his fathe
r to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierre's departure Helene returned
 to Petersburg, she was received by all her acquaintances not only cordially, but
 even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune. When conversation turned o
n her husband Helene assumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic ta
ct she had acquired though she did not understand its significance. This expressi
on suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and tha
t her husband was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince Vasili expressed his opini
on more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and, pointing
 to his forehead, remarked  "A bit touchedI always said so."  "I said from the fi
rst," declared Anna Pavlovna referring to Pierre, "I said at the time and before 
anyone else" she insisted on her priority "that that senseless young man was spoi
led by the depraved ideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybod
y was in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and when, if 
you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees. And how has it en
ded? I was against this marriage even then and foretold all that has happened."  
Anna Pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of soirees as befo
resuch as she alone had the gift of arrangingat which was to be found "the cream 
of really good society, the bloom of the intellectual essence of Petersburg," as 
she herself put it. Besides this refined selection of society Anna Pavlovna's rec
eptions were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new an
d interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state of the p
olitical thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court society so dearly and distinc
tly indicated.  Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon's de
struction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstadt and the surrender of most of
 the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our troops had already entered P
russia and our second war with Napoleon was beginning, Anna Pavlovna gave one of 
her soirees. The "cream of really good society" consisted of the fascinating Hele
ne, forsaken by her husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had j
ust returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a young man referred to
 in that drawing room as "a man of great merit" un homme de beaucoup de merite, a
 newly appointed maid of honor and her mother, and several other less noteworthy 
persons.  The novelty Anna Pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening wa
s Boris Drubetskoy, who had just arrived as a special messenger from the Prussian
 army and was aidedecamp to a very important personage.  The temperature shown by
 the political thermometer to the company that evening was this  "Whatever the Eu
ropean sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance Bonaparte, and to cause me
, and us in general, annoyance and mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot
 alter. We shall not cease to express our sincere views on that subject, and can 
only say to the King of Prussia and others 'So much the worse for you. Tu l'as vo
ulu, George Dandin,' that's all we have to say about it!"  When Boris, who was to
 be served up to the guests, entered the drawing room, almost all the company had
 assembled, and the conversation, guided by Anna Pavlovna, was about our diplomat
ic relations with Austria and the hope of an alliance with her.  Boris, grown mor
e manly and looking fresh, rosy and selfpossessed, entered the drawing room elega
ntly dressed in the uniform of an aidedecamp and was duly conducted to pay his re
spects to the aunt and then brought back to the general circle.  Anna Pavlovna ga
ve him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to several persons whom he d
id not know, giving him a whispered description of each.  "Prince Hippolyte Kurag
in, M. Krug, the charge d'affaires from Copenhagena profound intellect," and simp
ly, "Mr. Shitova man of great merit"this of the man usually so described.  Thanks
 to Anna Mikhaylovna's efforts, his own tastes, and the peculiarities of his rese
rved nature, Boris had managed during his service to place himself very advantage
ously. He was aidedecamp to a very important personage, had been sent on a very i
mportant mission to Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messen
ger. He had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he h
ad been so pleased at Olmutz and according to which an ensign might rank incompar
ably higher than a general, and according to which what was needed for success in
 the service was not effort or work, or courage, or perseverance, but only the kn
owledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards, and he was himself oft
en surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of others to und
erstand these things. In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, 
all his relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were completely
 altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to be better dressed th
an others, and would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself 
to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in an old 
uniform. He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those above him
 in position and who could therefore be of use to him. He liked Petersburg and de
spised Moscow. The remembrance of the Rostovs' house and of his childish love for
 Natasha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the Rostovs since 
the day of his departure for the army. To be in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room he c
onsidered an important step up in the service, and he at once understood his role
, letting his hostess make use of whatever interest he had to offer. He himself c
arefully scanned each face, appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy
 with each of those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took the se
at indicated to him beside the fair Helene and listened to the general conversati
on.  "Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that not 
even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them, and she doubts t
he means we have of gaining them. That is the actual phrase used by the Vienna ca
binet," said the Danish charge d'affaires.  "The doubt is flattering," said "the 
man of profound intellect," with a subtle smile.  "We must distinguish between th
e Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of Austria," said Mortemart. "The Emperor of Aus
tria can never have thought of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.
"  "Ah, my dear vicomte," put in Anna Pavlovna, "L'Urope" for some reason she cal
led it Urope as if that were a specially refined French pronunciation which she c
ould allow herself when conversing with a Frenchman, "L'Urope ne sera jamais notr
e alliee sincere." *       * "Europe will never be our sincere ally."   After tha
t Anna Pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King of Prussia, in ord
er to draw Boris into the conversation.  Boris listened attentively to each of th
e speakers, awaiting his turn, but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at 
his neighbor, the beautiful Helene, whose eyes several times met those of the han
dsome young aidedecamp with a smile.  Speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna P
avlovna very naturally asked Boris to tell them about his journey to Glogau and i
n what state he found the Prussian army. Boris, speaking with deliberation, told 
them in pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies and the co
urt, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about the facts h
e was recounting. For some time he engrossed the general attention, and Anna Pavl
ovna felt that the novelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all he
r visitors. The greatest attention of all to Boris' narrative was shown by Helene
. She asked him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested
 in the state of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished she turned to him 
with her usual smile.  "You absolutely must come and see me," she said in a tone 
that implied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was abso
lutely necessary.  "On Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great plea
sure."  Boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation 
with her, when Anna Pavlovna called him away on the pretext that her aunt wished 
to hear him.  "You know her husband, of course?" said Anna Pavlovna, closing her 
eyes and indicating Helene with a sorrowful gesture. "Ah, she is such an unfortun
ate and charming woman! Don't mention him before herplease don't! It is too painf
ul for her!"      CHAPTER VII   When Boris and Anna Pavlovna returned to the othe
rs Prince Hippolyte had the ear of the company.  Bending forward in his armchair 
he said "Le Roi de Prusse!" and having said this laughed. Everyone turned toward 
him.  "Le Roi de Prusse?" Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing, and the
n calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna Pavlovna waited for him to go 
on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she began to tell of how at Pot
sdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the sword of Frederick the Great.  "It is t
he sword of Frederick the Great which I..." she began, but Hippolyte interrupted 
her with the words "Le Roi de Prusse..." and again, as soon as all turned toward 
him, excused himself and said no more.  Anna Pavlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippoly
te's friend, addressed him firmly.  "Come now, what about your Roi de Prusse?"  H
ippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.  "Oh, it's nothing. I only wished to 
say..." he wanted to repeat a joke he had heard in Vienna and which he had been t
rying all that evening to get in "I only wished to say that we are wrong to fight
 pour le Roi de Prusse!"  Boris smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken a
s ironical or appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody 
laughed.  "Your joke is too bad, it's witty but unjust," said Anna Pavlovna, shak
ing her little shriveled finger at him.  "We are not fighting pour le Roi de Prus
se, but for right principles. Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!" she said.  The c
onversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the political news. It
 became particularly animated toward the end of the evening when the rewards best
owed by the Emperor were mentioned.  "You know N N received a snuffbox with the p
ortrait last year?" said "the man of profound intellect." "Why shouldn't S S get 
the same distinction?"  "Pardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperor's portrait is a r
eward but not a distinction," said the diplomatist"a gift, rather."  "There are p
recedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg."  "It's impossible," replied another.  "W
ill you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter...."  When everybody r
ose to go, Helene who had spoken very little all the evening again turned to Bori
s, asking him in a tone of caressing significant command to come to her on Tuesda
y.  "It is of great importance to me," she said, turning with a smile toward Anna
 Pavlovna, and Anna Pavlovna, with the same sad smile with which she spoke of her
 exalted patroness, supported Helene's wish.  It seemed as if from some words Bor
is had spoken that evening about the Prussian army, Helene had suddenly found it 
necessary to see him. She seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when
 he came on Tuesday.  But on Tuesday evening, having come to Helene's splendid sa
lon, Boris received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to 
come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to him, and only as 
he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a whisper, with a str
angely unsmiling face "Come to dinner tomorrow... in the evening. You must come..
.. Come!"  During that stay in Petersburg, Boris became an intimate in the counte
ss' house.      CHAPTER VIII   The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian fro
ntier. Everywhere one heard curses on Bonaparte, "the enemy of mankind." Militiam
en and recruits were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of war cam
e contradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously interpreted. The lif
e of old Prince Bolkonski, Prince Andrew, and Princess Mary had greatly changed s
ince 1805.  In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief 
then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia. Despite the
 weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable since the time when he
 thought his son had been killed, he did not think it right to refuse a duty to w
hich he had been appointed by the Emperor himself, and this fresh opportunity for
 action gave him new energy and strength. He was continually traveling through th
e three provinces entrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties
, severe to cruelty with his subordinates, and went into everything down to the m
inutest details himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics f
rom her father, and when the old prince was at home went to his study with the we
t nurse and little Prince Nicholas as his grandfather called him. The baby Prince
 Nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse Savishna in the late princess' rooms
 and Princess Mary spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a mother's place 
to her little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed passi
onately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself to give her fri
end the pleasure of dandling the little angelas she called her nephewand playing 
with him.  Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the
 tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument brought fr
om Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to fly upwards. The an
gel's upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile, and once on coming 
out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that th
e angel's face reminded them strangely of the little princess. But what was still
 stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in t
he expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel's face, Prince Andrew r
ead the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife "Ah, why have
 you done this to me?"  Soon after Prince Andrew's return the old prince made ove
r to him a large estate, Bogucharovo, about twentyfive miles from Bald Hills. Par
tly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly because
 Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his father's peculiariti
es, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Bogucharovo,
 began building and spent most of his time there.  After the Austerlitz campaign 
Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service, and when 
the war recommenced and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father i
n the recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son seeme
d to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man, roused by activi
ty, expected the best results from the new campaign, while Prince Andrew on the c
ontrary, taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this, saw only the dar
k side.  On February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits. Pri
nce Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father's absence. Little Ni
cholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who had driven the old prince 
to town returned bringing papers and letters for Prince Andrew.  Not finding the 
young prince in his study the valet went with the letters to Princess Mary's apar
tments, but did not find him there. He was told that the prince had gone to the n
ursery.  "If you please, your excellency, Petrusha has brought some papers," said
 one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a child's little chair
 while, frowning and with trembling hands, he poured drops from a medicine bottle
 into a wineglass half full of water.  "What is it?" he said crossly, and, his ha
nd shaking unintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the
 mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought it.  Ther
e were in the room a child's cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a table, a child's ta
ble, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew was sitting. The curtains were d
rawn, and a single candle was burning on the table, screened by a bound music boo
k so that the light did not fall on the cot.  "My dear," said Princess Mary, addr
essing her brother from beside the cot where she was standing, "better wait a bit
... later..."  "Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things o
ffand this is what comes of it!" said Prince Andrew in an exasperated whisper, ev
idently meaning to wound his sister.  "My dear, really... it's better not to wake
 him... he's asleep," said the princess in a tone of entreaty.  Prince Andrew got
 up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass in hand.  "Perhaps we'd re
ally better not wake him," he said hesitating.  "As you please... really... I thi
nk so... but as you please," said Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confus
ed that her opinion had prevailed. She drew her brother's attention to the maid w
ho was calling him in a whisper.  It was the second night that neither of them ha
d slept, watching the boy who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting t
heir household doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they 
had been trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness and 
anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and reproached and dispu
ted with each other.  "Petrusha has come with papers from your father," whispered
 the maid.  Prince Andrew went out.  "Devil take them!" he muttered, and after li
stening to the verbal instructions his father had sent and taking the corresponde
nce and his father's letter, he returned to the nursery.  "Well?" he asked.  "Sti
ll the same. Wait, for heaven's sake. Karl Ivanich always says that sleep is more
 important than anything," whispered Princess Mary with a sigh.  Prince Andrew we
nt up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.  "Confound you and your Karl
 Ivanich!" He took the glass with the drops and again went up to the cot.  "Andre
w, don't!" said Princess Mary.  But he scowled at her angrily though also with su
ffering in his eyes, and stooped glass in hand over the infant.  "But I wish it,"
 he said. "I beg yougive it him!"  Princess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took 
the glass submissively and calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child
 screamed hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sa
t down on a sofa in the next room.  He still had all the letters in his hand. Ope
ning them mechanically he began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbre
viations, wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows   Have just 
this moment received by special messenger very joyful newsif it's not false. Benn
igsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Pete
rsburg everyone is rejoicing, and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. T
hough he is a GermanI congratulate him! I can't make out what the commander at Ko
rchevoa certain Khandrikovis up to till now the additional men and provisions hav
e not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and say I'll have his head off if everyt
hing is not here in a week. Have received another letter about the PreussischEyla
u battle from Petenkahe took part in itand it's all true. When mischiefmakers don
't meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is said to be fleeing in great disor
der. Mind you gallop off to Korchevo without delay and carry out instructions!   
Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was a closely wri
tten letter of two sheets from Bilibin. He folded it up without reading it and re
read his father's letter, ending with the words "Gallop off to Korchevo and carry
 out instructions!"  "No, pardon me, I won't go now till the child is better," th
ought he, going to the door and looking into the nursery.  Princess Mary was stil
l standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.  "Ah yes, and what else did he sa
y that's unpleasant?" thought Prince Andrew, recalling his father's letter. "Yes,
 we have gained a victory over Bonaparte, just when I'm not serving. Yes, yes, he
's always poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!" And he began reading Bilibin's
 letter which was written in French. He read without understanding half of it, re
ad only to forget, if but for a moment, what he had too long been thinking of so 
painfully to the exclusion of all else.      CHAPTER IX   Bilibin was now at army
 headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and though he wrote in French and used Fr
ench jests and French idioms, he described the whole campaign with a fearless sel
fcensure and selfderision genuinely Russian. Bilibin wrote that the obligation of
 diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince Andrew a
 reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at 
the sight of all that was being done in the army. The letter was old, having been
 written before the battle at PreussischEylau.  "Since the day of our brilliant s
uccess at Austerlitz," wrote Bilibin, "as you know, my dear prince, I never leave
 headquarters. I have certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well 
for me what I have seen during these last three months is incredible.  "I begin a
b ovo. 'The enemy of the human race,' as you know, attacks the Prussians. The Pru
ssians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us three times in three yea
rs. We take up their cause, but it turns out that 'the enemy of the human race' p
ays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on
 the Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun, and 
in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in t
he palace at Potsdam.  "'I most ardently desire,' writes the King of Prussia to B
onaparte, 'that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a man
ner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances allowed, I have hastene
d to take all steps to that end. May I have succeeded!' The Prussian generals pri
de themselves on being polite to the French and lay down their arms at the first 
demand.  "The head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the Kin
g of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All this is abso
lutely true.  "In short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude
, it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more, in war on 
our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have everything in perfec
t order, only one little thing is lacking, namely, a commander in chief. As it wa
s considered that the Austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the co
mmander in chief not been so young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of P
rozorovski and Kamenski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us, Suvoro
vlike, in a kibitka, and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph.  "On t
he 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails are taken to the fie
ld marshal's room, for he likes to do everything himself. I am called in to help 
sort the letters and take those meant for us. The field marshal looks on and wait
s for letters addressed to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field ma
rshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor
 to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild furies a
nd rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens them, and reads th
ose from the Emperor addressed to others. 'Ah! So that's the way they treat me! N
o confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep an eye on me! Very well then! Get along w
ith you!' So he writes the famous order of the day to General Bennigsen  'I am wo
unded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army. You have brought 
your army corps to Pultusk, routed here it is exposed, and without fuel or forage
, so something must be done, and, as you yourself reported to Count Buxhowden yes
terday, you must think of retreating to our frontierwhich do today.'  "'From all 
my riding,' he writes to the Emperor, 'I have got a saddle sore which, coming aft
er all my previous journeys, quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an a
rmy, so I have passed on the command to the general next in seniority, Count Buxh
owden, having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if
 there is a lack of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only
 one day's ration of bread remains, and in some regiments none at all, as reporte
d by the division commanders, Ostermann and Sedmoretzki, and all that the peasant
s had has been eaten up. I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I re
cover. In regard to which I humbly submit my report, with the information that if
 the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a he
althy man left in it by spring.  "'Grant leave to retire to his country seat to a
n old man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the gr
eat and glorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious p
ermission here in hospital, that I may not have to play the part of a secretary r
ather than commander in the army. My removal from the army does not produce the s
lightest stira blind man has left it. There are thousands such as I in Russia.'  
"The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all, isn't it log
ical?  "This is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly inter
esting and entertaining. After the field marshal's departure it appears that we a
re within sight of the enemy and must give battle. Buxhowden is commander in chie
f by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it more particularly as 
it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit 
by the opportunity to fight a battle 'on his own hand' as the Germans say. He doe
s so. This is the battle of Pultusk, which is considered a great victory but in m
y opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way
 of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle h
ave lost it is what we say and according to that it is we who lost the battle of 
Pultusk. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg w
ith news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg t
he post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the c
ommand of the army to General Buxhowden. During this interregnum we begin a very 
original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should 
be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid General Buxhowden who by ri
ght of seniority should be our chief. So energetically do we pursue this aim that
 after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves fro
m our enemy, who at the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxhowden. General Buxhowden 
was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of
 these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him. Buxhowden pursues uswe scuttle. H
e hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other. At last ou
r enemy. Buxhowden, catches us and attacks. Both generals are angry, and the resu
lt is a challenge on Buxhowden's part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsen's. But at
 the critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at Pultusk t
o Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief, and our firs
t foe, Buxhowden, is vanquished we can now turn our thoughts to the second, Bonap
arte. But as it turns out, just at that moment a third enemy rises before usnamel
y the Orthodox Russian soldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, 
and whatnot! The stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looti
ng, and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea. Half the regime
nts form bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword. Th
e inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals overflow with sick, and famine is
 everywhere. Twice the marauders even attack our headquarters, and the commander 
in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them. During one of these attacks
 they carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor proposes
 to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much fea
r this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other."  At first Prince Andrew
 read with his eyes only, but after a while, in spite of himself although he knew
 how far it was safe to trust Bilibin, what he had read began to interest him mor
e and more. When he had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it awa
y. It was not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out the
re in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his eyes, rubbed his fo
rehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read, and listened to 
what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise thr
ough the door. He was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to th
e child while he was reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door an
d opened it.  Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from 
him with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.  "My dear
," he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him.  As often happe
ns after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was seized by an unreasoning pan
icit occurred to him that the child was dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to
 confirm this terror.  "All is over," he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on h
is forehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it empty an
d that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the curtain aside and for
 some time his frightened, restless eyes could not find the baby. At last he saw 
him the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his head lower 
than the pillow, and was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly.  Pr
ince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had already lost him.
 He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him, tried with his lips whether 
the child was still feverish. The soft forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched 
the head with his hand even the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspire
d. He was not dead, but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent. Pr
ince Andrew longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless 
little creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing at his head and a
t the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He heard a rustle behi
nd him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot. He did not look round,
 but still gazing at the infant's face listened to his regular breathing. The dar
k shadow was Princess Mary, who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lift
ed the curtain, and dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her wit
hout looking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.  "He has perspired," s
aid Prince Andrew.  "I was coming to tell you so."  The child moved slightly in h
is sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead against the pillow.  Prince Andrew look
ed at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes shone more b
rightly than usual from the tears of joy that were in them. She leaned over to he
r brother and kissed him, slightly catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the
 other a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as 
if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all th
e world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair against the 
muslin of the curtain.  "Yes, this is the one thing left me now," he said with a 
sigh.      CHAPTER X   Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierr
e went to the Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking wi
th him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what 
he should do on his estates.  When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards t
o the head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them t
hat steps would be taken immediately to free his serfsand that till then they wer
e not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies were not to
 be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs, punishments were to be
 admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals, asylums, and schools were to be esta
blished on all the estates. Some of the stewards there were semiliterate foremen 
among them listened with alarm, supposing these words to mean that the young coun
t was displeased with their management and embezzlement of money, some after thei
r first fright were amused by Pierre's lisp and the new words they had not heard 
before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while the cleverest 
among them, including the chief steward, understood from this speech how they cou
ld best handle the master for their own ends.  The chief steward expressed great 
sympathy with Pierre's intentions, but remarked that besides these changes it wou
ld be necessary to go into the general state of affairs which was far from satisf
actory.  Despite Count Bezukhov's enormous wealth, since he had come into an inco
me which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year, Pierre felt h
imself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of ten thousand 
rubles. He had a dim perception of the following budget  About 80,000 went in pay
ments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about 30,000 went for the upkeep of th
e estate near Moscow, the town house, and the allowance to the three princesses a
bout 15,000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums 150,000 alimony
 was sent to the countess about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building o
f a new church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two y
ears, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was spent, and almo
st every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the chief steward wrote ever
y year telling him of fires and bad harvests, or of the necessity of rebuilding f
actories and workshops. So the first task Pierre had to face was one for which he
 had very little aptitude or inclinationpractical business.  He discussed estate 
affairs every day with his chief steward. But he felt that this did not forward m
atters at all. He felt that these consultations were detached from real affairs a
nd did not link up with them or make them move. On the one hand, the chief stewar
d put the state of things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the necess
ity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor, to wh
ich Pierre did not agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that steps should be
 taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by showing the necessity of f
irst paying off the loans from the Land Bank, and the consequent impossibility of
 a speedy emancipation.  The steward did not say it was quite impossible, but sug
gested selling the forests in the province of Kostroma, the land lower down the r
iver, and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible all of which operation
s according to him were connected with such complicated measuresthe removal of in
junctions, petitions, permits, and so onthat Pierre became quite bewildered and o
nly replied  "Yes, yes, do so."  Pierre had none of the practical persistence tha
t would have enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it 
and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward
 for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultation
s very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself.  In Kiev Pierre fo
und some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make his acquaintance and joyf
ully welcomed the rich newcomer, the largest landowner of the province. Temptatio
ns to Pierre's greatest weaknessthe one to which he had confessed when admitted t
o the Lodgewere so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days, weeks,
 and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with 
evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him no time for reflection, 
as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the
 old life, only in new surroundings.  Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre
 realized that he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an ex
ample of moral life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked twomorality and the 
love of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of 
the preceptsthat of reforming the human raceand had other virtueslove of his neig
hbor, and especially generosity.  In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to P
etersburg. On the way he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself ho
w far his orders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God h
ad entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.  The chief steward, who
 considered the young count's attempts almost insaneunprofitable to himself, to t
he count, and to the serfsmade some concessions. Continuing to represent the libe
ration of the serfs as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large build
ingsschools, hospitals, and asylumson all the estates before the master arrived. 
Everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes which he knew Pier
re would not like, but for just such gratefully religious ones, with offerings of
 icons and the bread and salt of hospitality, as, according to his understanding 
of his master, would touch and delude him.  The southern spring, the comfortable 
rapid traveling in a Vienna carriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gla
ddening effect on Pierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more pi
cturesque than the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grat
eful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions, which though
 they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart. In 
one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Pet
er and Saint Paul, asking permission, as a mark of their gratitude for the benefi
ts he had conferred on them, to build a new chantry to the church at their own ex
pense in honor of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In another place the women w
ith infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work. On a 
third estate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet him surrounded by children
 whom, by the count's generosity, he was instructing in reading, writing, and rel
igion. On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or
 in course of erection, all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, 
which were soon to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewards' accounts, according
 to which the serfs' manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the touching t
hanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted blue coats.  What Pierre did n
ot know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wishe
d to build a chantry in honor of Peter and Paul was a market village where a fair
 was held on St. Peter's day, and that the richest peasants who formed the deputa
tion had begun the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in t
hat villages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know that since 
the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they did still harde
r work on their own land. He did not know that the priest who met him with the cr
oss oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and that the pupils' parents wept at
 having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payment
s. He did not know that the brick buildings, built to plan, were being built by s
erfs whose manorial labor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. He did no
t know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs' payme
nts had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work had been incre
ased by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and qui
te recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left Petersburg, and wrote en
thusiastic letters to his "brotherinstructor" as he called the Grand Master.  "Ho
w easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good," thought Pierre, "a
nd how little attention we pay to it!"  He was pleased at the gratitude he receiv
ed, but felt abashed at receiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much mor
e he might do for these simple, kindly people.  The chief steward, a very stupid 
but cunning man who saw perfectly through the naive and intelligent count and pla
yed with him as with a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on
 Pierre, pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all 
the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.  Pierre in 
his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine hap
pier people, and that God only knew what would happen to them when they were free
, but he insisted, though reluctantly, on what he thought right. The steward prom
ised to do all in his power to carry out the count's wishes, seeing clearly that 
not only would the count never be able to find out whether all measures had been 
taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank
, but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erect
ed buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in money an
d work all that other people's serfs gavethat is to say, all that could be got ou
t of them.      CHAPTER XI   Returning from his journey through South Russia in t
he happiest state of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of vis
iting his friend Bolkonski, whom he had not seen for two years.  Bogucharovo lay 
in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields and forests of fir and b
irch, which were partly cut down. The house lay behind a newly dug pond filled wi
th water to the brink and with banks still bare of grass. It was at the end of a 
village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which 
were a few fir trees.  The homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, s
tables, a bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular facade st
ill in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid out. The f
ences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and a water cart, painted green
, stood in a shed the paths were straight, the bridges were strong and had handra
ils. Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management. Some domestic se
rfs Pierre met, in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a
 small newly built lodge close to the pond. Anton, a man who had looked after Pri
nce Andrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the princ
e was at home, and showed him into a clean little anteroom.  Pierre was struck by
 the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in 
which he had last met his friend in Petersburg.  He quickly entered the small rec
eption room with its stillunplastered wooden walls redolent of pine, and would ha
ve gone farther, but Anton ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.  "Well, wha
t is it?" came a sharp, unpleasant voice.  "A visitor," answered Anton.  "Ask him
 to wait," and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back.  Pierre went wit
h rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face with Prince Andrew, who 
came out frowning and looking old. Pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles
 kissed his friend on the cheek and looked at him closely.  "Well, I did not expe
ct you, I am very glad," said Prince Andrew.  Pierre said nothing he looked fixed
ly at his friend with surprise. He was struck by the change in him. His words wer
e kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and l
ifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous
 and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more manlylooking,
 but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and
 a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought.  A
s is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation, it was lo
ng before their conversation could settle on anything. They put questions and gav
e brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked over at length. At last
 the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touche
d on their past life, plans for the future, Pierre's journeys and occupations, th
e war, and so on. The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in h
is friend's look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he 
listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or
 the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what 
Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter began to feel that it was in bad tas
te to speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Pr
ince Andrew's presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which ha
d been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He checked himself
, fearing to seem naive, yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as
 soon as possible that he was now a quite different, and better, Pierre than he h
ad been in Petersburg.  "I can't tell you how much I have lived through since the
n. I hardly know myself again."  "Yes, we have altered much, very much, since the
n," said Prince Andrew.  "Well, and you? What are your plans?"  "Plans!" repeated
 Prince Andrew ironically. "My plans?" he said, as if astonished at the word. "We
ll, you see, I'm building. I mean to settle here altogether next year...."  Pierr
e looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew's face, which had grown much
 older.  "No, I meant to ask..." Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him.
  "But why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and all you
 have been doing on your estates."  Pierre began describing what he had done on h
is estates, trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements
 that had been made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre's story of what 
he had been doing, as though it were all an oldtime story, and he listened not on
ly without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him.  Pierr
e felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend's company and at last becam
e silent.  "I'll tell you what, my dear fellow," said Prince Andrew, who evidentl
y also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, "I am only bivouacking he
re and have just come to look round. I am going back to my sister today. I will i
ntroduce you to her. But of course you know her already," he said, evidently tryi
ng to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common. "We will go a
fter dinner. And would you now like to look round my place?"  They went out and w
alked about till dinnertime, talking of the political news and common acquaintanc
es like people who do not know each other intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with so
me animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its b
uildings, but even here, while on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explain
ing the future arrangements of the house, he interrupted himself  "However, this 
is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then we'll set off."  At dinne
r, conversation turned on Pierre's marriage.  "I was very much surprised when I h
eard of it," said Prince Andrew.  Pierre blushed, as he always did when it was me
ntioned, and said hurriedly "I will tell you some time how it all happened. But y
ou know it is all over, and forever."  "Forever?" said Prince Andrew. "Nothing's 
forever."  "But you know how it all ended, don't you? You heard of the duel?"  "A
nd so you had to go through that too!"  "One thing I thank God for is that I did 
not kill that man," said Pierre.  "Why so?" asked Prince Andrew. "To kill a vicio
us dog is a very good thing really."  "No, to kill a man is badwrong."  "Why is i
t wrong?" urged Prince Andrew. "It is not given to man to know what is right and 
what is wrong. Men always did and always will err, and in nothing more than in wh
at they consider right and wrong."  "What does harm to another is wrong," said Pi
erre, feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andr
ew was roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to h
is present state.  "And who has told you what is bad for another man?" he asked. 
 "Bad! Bad!" exclaimed Pierre. "We all know what is bad for ourselves."  "Yes, we
 know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something I cannot inflic
t on others," said Prince Andrew, growing more and more animated and evidently wi
shing to express his new outlook to Pierre. He spoke in French. "I only know two 
very real evils in life remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of thos
e evils. To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now."
  "And love of one's neighbor, and selfsacrifice?" began Pierre. "No, I can't agr
ee with you! To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not e
nough. I lived like that, I lived for myself and ruined my life. And only now whe
n I am living, or at least trying" Pierre's modesty made him correct himself "to 
live for others, only now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I shal
l not agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are saying." Prince 
Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.  "When you see my sister, 
Princess Mary, you'll get on with her," he said. "Perhaps you are right for yours
elf," he added after a short pause, "but everyone lives in his own way. You lived
 for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when y
ou began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I lived for glory.And
 after all what is glory? The same love of others, a desire to do something for t
hem, a desire for their approval.So I lived for others, and not almost, but quite
, ruined my life. And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself.
"  "But what do you mean by living only for yourself?" asked Pierre, growing exci
ted. "What about your son, your sister, and your father?"  "But that's just the s
ame as myselfthey are not others," explained Prince Andrew. "The others, one's ne
ighbors, le prochain, as you and Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of a
ll error and evil. Le prochainyour Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good."  A
nd he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He evidently wishe
d to draw him on.  "You are joking," replied Pierre, growing more and more excite
d. "What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even doing a li
ttlethough I did very little and did it very badly? What evil can there be in it 
if unfortunate people, our serfs, people like ourselves, were growing up and dyin
g with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are
 now instructed in a comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, a
nd consolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying of dise
ase without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered, and I sup
plied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum for the aged? And is it not a
 palpable, unquestionable good if a peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest 
day or night and I give them rest and leisure?" said Pierre, hurrying and lisping
. "And I have done that though badly and to a small extent but I have done someth
ing toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action, and more 
than that, you can't make me believe that you do not think so yourself. And the m
ain thing is," he continued, "that I know, and know for certain, that the enjoyme
nt of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life."  "Yes, if you put it l
ike that it's quite a different matter," said Prince Andrew. "I build a house and
 lay out a garden, and you build hospitals. The one and the other may serve as a 
pastime. But what's right and what's good must be judged by one who knows all, bu
t not by us. Well, you want an argument," he added, "come on then."  They rose fr
om the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda.  "Come
, let's argue then," said Prince Andrew, "You talk of schools," he went on, crook
ing a finger, "education and so forth that is, you want to raise him" pointing to
 a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap "from his animal condition and a
waken in him spiritual needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the o
nly happiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him of. I envy 
him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him my means. Then you sa
y, 'lighten his toil.' But as I see it, physical labor is as essential to him, as
 much a condition of his existence, as mental activity is to you or me. You can't
 help thinking. I go to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I can't s
leep but toss about till dawn, because I think and can't help thinking, just as h
e can't help plowing and mowing if he didn't, he would go to the drink shop or fa
ll ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of i
t in a week, so he could not stand my physical idleness, but would grow fat and d
ie. The third thingwhat else was it you talked about?" and Prince Andrew crooked 
a third finger. "Ah, yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you
 come and bleed him and patch him up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden t
o everybody, for another ten years. It would be far easier and simpler for him to
 die. Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is. It would be di
fferent if you grudged losing a laborerthat's how I regard himbut you want to cur
e him from love of him. And he does not want that. And besides, what a notion tha
t medicine ever cured anyone! Killed them, yes!" said he, frowning angrily and tu
rning away from Pierre.  Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinc
tly that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he s
poke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His glanc
e became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.  "Oh, that is dre
adful, dreadful!" said Pierre. "I don't understand how one can live with such ide
as. I had such moments myself not long ago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at 
such times I collapsed so that I don't live at alleverything seems hateful to me.
.. myself most of all. Then I don't eat, don't wash... and how is it with you?...
"  "Why not wash? That is not cleanly," said Prince Andrew "on the contrary one m
ust try to make one's life as pleasant as possible. I'm alive, that is not my fau
lt, so I must live out my life as best I can without hurting others."  "But with 
such ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit without moving, underta
king nothing...."  "Life as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do
 nothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to c
hoose me to be their marshal it was all I could do to get out of it. They could n
ot understand that I have not the necessary qualifications for itthe kind of good
natured, fussy shallowness necessary for the position. Then there's this house, w
hich must be built in order to have a nook of one's own in which to be quiet. And
 now there's this recruiting."  "Why aren't you serving in the army?"  "After Aus
terlitz!" said Prince Andrew gloomily. "No, thank you very much! I have promised 
myself not to serve again in the active Russian army. And I won'tnot even if Bona
parte were here at Smolensk threatening Bald Hillseven then I wouldn't serve in t
he Russian army! Well, as I was saying," he continued, recovering his composure, 
"now there's this recruiting. My father is chief in command of the Third District
, and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him."  "Then you a
re serving?"  "I am."  He paused a little while.  "And why do you serve?"  "Why, 
for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of his time. But he 
is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too energetic a character. He
 is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible, and now he has this aut
hority of a commander in chief of the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I ha
d been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster's clerk at Yu
khnovna hanged," said Prince Andrew with a smile. "So I am serving because I alon
e have any influence with my father, and now and then can save him from actions w
hich would torment him afterwards."  "Well, there you see!"  "Yes, but it is not 
as you imagine," Prince Andrew continued. "I did not, and do not, in the least ca
re about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the recruits I 
should even have been very glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my fathert
hat again is for myself."  Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes gl
ittered feverishly while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there wa
s no desire to do good to his neighbor.  "There now, you wish to liberate your se
rfs," he continued "that is a very good thing, but not for youI don't suppose you
 ever had anyone flogged or sent to Siberiaand still less for your serfs. If they
 are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I don't suppose they are any the worse 
off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the stripes on their bodies h
eal, and they are happy as before. But it is a good thing for proprietors who per
ish morally, bring remorse upon themselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous,
 as a result of being able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is thos
e people I pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You may 
not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those traditions of un
limited power, in time when they grow more irritable, become cruel and harsh, are
 conscious of it, but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable
."  Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking that the
se thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his father's case.  He did not
 reply.  "So that's what I'm sorry forhuman dignity, peace of mind, purity, and n
ot the serfs' backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave as you may, always remai
n the same backs and foreheads."  "No, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agr
ee with you," said Pierre.      CHAPTER XII   In the evening Andrew and Pierre go
t into the open carriage and drove to Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pier
re, broke the silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a goo
d temper.  Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in 
his husbandry.  Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and a
pparently immersed in his own thoughts.  He was thinking that Prince Andrew was u
nhappy, had gone astray, did not see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought t
o aid, enlighten, and raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say,
 he felt that Prince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teac
hing, and he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what 
to him was precious and sacred.  "No, but why do you think so?" Pierre suddenly b
egan, lowering his head and looking like a bull about to charge, "why do you thin
k so? You should not think so."  "Think? What about?" asked Prince Andrew with su
rprise.  "About life, about man's destiny. It can't be so. I myself thought like 
that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don't smile. Freemasonry is
 not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it was Freemasonry is the best exp
ression of the best, the eternal, aspects of humanity."  And he began to explain 
Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the
 teaching of Christianity freed from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of
 equality, brotherhood, and love.  "Only our holy brotherhood has the real meanin
g of life, all the rest is a dream," said Pierre. "Understand, my dear fellow, th
at outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with yo
u that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life, 
like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our fundamental convictions 
your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up to us, let yourself be guided, a
nd you will at once feel yourself, as I have felt myself, a part of that vast inv
isible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven," said Pierre.  Prince An
drew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to Pierre's words. Mo
re than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented his catching what Pierre sai
d, he asked him to repeat it, and by the peculiar glow that came into Prince Andr
ew's eyes and by his silence, Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that
 Prince Andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said.  They reached a 
river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to cross by ferry. While t
he carriage and horses were being placed on it, they also stepped on the raft.  P
rince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at the floodin
g waters glittering in the setting sun.  "Well, what do you think about it?" Pier
re asked. "Why are you silent?"  "What do I think about it? I am listening to you
. It's all very well.... You say join our brotherhood and we will show you the ai
m of life, the destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who are w
e? Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see what you see? You s
ee a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I don't see it."  Pierre interrupt
ed him.  "Do you believe in a future life?" he asked.  "A future life?" Prince An
drew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no time to reply, took the repetition for a
 denial, the more readily as he knew Prince Andrew's former atheistic convictions
.  "You say you can't see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor could I, an
d it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of everything. On ea
rth, here on this earth" Pierre pointed to the fields, "there is no truth, all is
 false and evil but in the universe, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of 
truth, and we who are now the children of earth areeternallychildren of the whole
 universe. Don't I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole? 
Don't I feel that I form one link, one step, between the lower and higher beings,
 in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the Deitythe Supreme Power i
f you prefer the termis manifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from
 plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther a
nd farther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this world, bu
t that I shall always exist and always have existed. I feel that beyond me and ab
ove me there are spirits, and that in this world there is truth."  "Yes, that is 
Herder's theory," said Prince Andrew, "but it is not that which can convince me, 
dear friendlife and death are what convince. What convinces is when one sees a be
ing dear to one, bound up with one's own life, before whom one was to blame and h
ad hoped to make it right" Prince Andrew's voice trembled and he turned away, "an
d suddenly that being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to exist.... Why? 
It cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe there is.... That's what conv
inces, that is what has convinced me," said Prince Andrew.  "Yes, yes, of course,
" said Pierre, "isn't that what I'm saying?"  "No. All I say is that it is not ar
gument that convinces me of the necessity of a future life, but this when you go 
hand in hand with someone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowher
e, and you yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have looked in
...."  "Well, that's it then! You know that there is a there and there is a Someo
ne? There is the future life. The Someone isGod."  Prince Andrew did not reply. T
he carriage and horses had long since been taken off, onto the farther bank, and 
reharnessed. The sun had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was sta
rring the puddles near the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of t
he footmen, coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.  "If ther
e is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and man's highest happiness 
consists in striving to attain them. We must live, we must love, and we must beli
eve that we live not only today on this scrap of earth, but have lived and shall 
live forever, there, in the Whole," said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.  Prin
ce Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to Pierre, and he ga
zed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue wat
ers. There was perfect stillness. Pierre became silent. The raft had long since s
topped and only the waves of the current beat softly against it below. Prince And
rew felt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre's words, whispe
ring  "It is true, believe it."  He sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike
, tender look at Pierre's face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his sup
erior friend.  "Yes, if it only were so!" said Prince Andrew. "However, it is tim
e to get on," he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up at the sky to wh
ich Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since Austerlitz saw that high, ev
erlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield and something that had 
long been slumbering, something that was best within him, suddenly awoke, joyful 
and youthful, in his soul. It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary co
nditions of his life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to 
develop existed within him. His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince And
rew's life. Though outwardly he continued to live in the same old way, inwardly h
e began a new life.      CHAPTER XIII   It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew an
d Pierre drove up to the front entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they appro
ached the house, Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierre's attention to a commotio
n going on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her back, 
and a short, longhaired, young man in a black garment had rushed back to the gate
 on seeing the carriage driving up. Two women ran out after them, and all four, l
ooking round at the carriage, ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch.  "Tho
se are Mary's 'God's folk,'" said Prince Andrew. "They have mistaken us for my fa
ther. This is the one matter in which she disobeys him. He orders these pilgrims 
to be driven away, but she receives them."  "But what are 'God's folk'?" asked Pi
erre.  Prince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet them, a
nd he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back soon.  The 
old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.  Prince Andrew 
led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept in perfect order and rea
diness for him in his father's house he himself went to the nursery.  "Let us go 
and see my sister," he said to Pierre when he returned. "I have not found her yet
, she is hiding now, sitting with her 'God's folk.' It will serve her right, she 
will be confused, but you will see her 'God's folk.' It's really very curious."  
"What are 'God's folk'?" asked Pierre.  "Come, and you'll see for yourself."  Pri
ncess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face when they wen
t in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon stand, a young lad wit
h a long nose and long hair, wearing a monk's cassock, sat on the sofa beside her
, behind a samovar. Near them, in an armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, 
with a meek expression on her childlike face.  "Andrew, why didn't you warn me?" 
said the princess, with mild reproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a he
n before her chickens.  "Charmee de vous voir. Je suis tres contente de vous voir
," * she said to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child, and 
now his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above all his k
indly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She looked at him with her 
beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, "I like you very much, but please don't
 laugh at my people." After exchanging the first greetings, they sat down.       
* "Delighted to see you. I am very glad to see you."   "Ah, and Ivanushka is here
 too!" said Prince Andrew, glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim.  "Andrew!"
 said Princess Mary, imploringly. "Il faut que vous sachiez que c'est une femme,"
 * said Prince Andrew to Pierre.  "Andrew, au nom de Dieu!" *2 Princess Mary repe
ated.        * "You must know that this is a woman."       * 2 "For heaven's sake
."   It was evident that Prince Andrew's ironical tone toward the pilgrims and Pr
incess Mary's helpless attempts to protect them were their customary longestablis
hed relations on the matter.  "Mais, ma bonne amie," said Prince Andrew, "vous de
vriez au contraire m'etre reconnaissante de ce que j'explique a Pierre votre inti
mite avec ce jeune homme." *        * "But, my dear, you ought on the contrary to
 be grateful to      me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young   
   man."   "Really?" said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and s
eriousness for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him into Ivanushka's
 face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked round at them all with
 crafty eyes.  Princess Mary's embarrassment on her people's account was quite un
necessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, lowering her eyes b
ut casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup upside down and plac
ed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat quietly in her armchair, though hopi
ng to be offered another cup of tea. Ivanushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked
 with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men.  "Where have you b
een? To Kiev?" Prince Andrew asked the old woman.  "I have, good sir," she answer
ed garrulously. "Just at Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy
 and heavenly sacrament at the shrine of the saint. And now I'm from Kolyazin, ma
ster, where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed."  "And was Ivanushk
a with you?"  "I go by myself, benefactor," said Ivanushka, trying to speak in a 
bass voice. "I only came across Pelageya in Yukhnovo..."  Pelageya interrupted he
r companion she evidently wished to tell what she had seen.  "In Kolyazin, master
, a wonderful blessing has been revealed."  "What is it? Some new relics?" asked 
Prince Andrew.  "Andrew, do leave off," said Princess Mary. "Don't tell him, Pela
geya."  "No... why not, my dear, why shouldn't I? I like him. He is kind, he is o
ne of God's chosen, he's a benefactor, he once gave me ten rubles, I remember. Wh
en I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me he's one of God's own and goes barefoot 
summer and winter, he says, 'Why are you not going to the right place? Go to Koly
azin where a wonderworking icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.' On 
hearing those words I said goodby to the holy folk and went."  All were silent, o
nly the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones, drawing in her breath.  "So I co
me, master, and the people say to me 'A great blessing has been revealed, holy oi
l trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother, the Holy Virgin Mother of God'.
..."  "All right, all right, you can tell us afterwards," said Princess Mary, flu
shing.  "Let me ask her," said Pierre. "Did you see it yourselves?" he inquired. 
 "Oh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the face like the lig
ht of heaven, and from the blessed Mother's cheek it drops and drops...."  "But, 
dear me, that must be a fraud!" said Pierre, naively, who had listened attentivel
y to the pilgrim.  "Oh, master, what are you saying?" exclaimed the horrified Pel
ageya, turning to Princess Mary for support.  "They impose on the people," he rep
eated.  "Lord Jesus Christ!" exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself. "Oh, 
don't speak so, master! There was a general who did not believe, and said, 'The m
onks cheat,' and as soon as he'd said it he went blind. And he dreamed that the H
oly Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and said, 'Believe in me and 
I will make you whole.' So he begged 'Take me to her, take me to her.' It's the r
eal truth I'm telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought, quite blind, strai
ght to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and says, 'Make me whole,' says 
he, 'and I'll give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me.' I saw it myself, master, t
he star is fixed into the icon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sigh
t! It's a sin to speak so. God will punish you," she said admonishingly, turning 
to Pierre.  "How did the star get into the icon?" Pierre asked.  "And was the Hol
y Mother promoted to the rank of general?" said Prince Andrew, with a smile.  Pel
ageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.  "Oh, master, master, what 
a sin! And you who have a son!" she began, her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid
 red. "Master, what have you said? God forgive you!" And she crossed herself. "Lo
rd forgive him! My dear, what does it mean?..." she asked, turning to Princess Ma
ry. She got up and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She evidently fel
t frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things co
uld be said, and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of t
his house.  "Now, why need you do it?" said Princess Mary. "Why did you come to m
e?..."  "Come, Pelageya, I was joking," said Pierre. "Princesse, ma parole, je n'
ai pas voulu l'offenser. * I did not mean anything, I was only joking," he said, 
smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense. "It was all my fault, and Andrew 
was only joking."       * "Princess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her."  
 Pelageya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre's face there was such a look of since
re penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now at Pierre, t
hat she was gradually reassured.      CHAPTER XIV   The pilgrim woman was appease
d and, being encouraged to talk, gave a long account of Father Amphilochus, who l
ed so holy a life that his hands smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to
 Kiev some monks she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, ta
king some dried bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with the sain
ts. "I'd pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to another. I'd sleep a bi
t and then again go and kiss the relics, and there was such peace all around, suc
h blessedness, that one don't want to come out, even into the light of heaven aga
in."  Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went out of
 the room, and then, leaving "God's folk" to finish their tea, Princess Mary took
 Pierre into the drawing room.  "You are very kind," she said to him.  "Oh, I rea
lly did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them so well and have the gre
atest respect for them."  Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affecti
onately.  "I have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a b
rother," she said. "How do you find Andrew?" she added hurriedly, not giving him 
time to reply to her affectionate words. "I am very anxious about him. His health
 was better in the winter, but last spring his wound reopened and the doctor said
 he ought to go away for a cure. And I am also very much afraid for him spiritual
ly. He has not a character like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our s
orrows. He keeps it all within him. Today he is cheerful and in good spirits, but
 that is the effect of your visithe is not often like that. If you could persuade
 him to go abroad. He needs activity, and this quiet regular life is very bad for
 him. Others don't notice it, but I see it."  Toward ten o'clock the men servants
 rushed to the front door, hearing the bells of the old prince's carriage approac
hing. Prince Andrew and Pierre also went out into the porch.  "Who's that?" asked
 the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out of the carriage.  "Ah! Very glad! 
Kiss me," he said, having learned who the young stranger was.  The old prince was
 in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.  Before supper, Prince Andrew, com
ing back to his father's study, found him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierr
e was maintaining that a time would come when there would be no more wars. The ol
d prince disputed it chaffingly, but without getting angry.  "Drain the blood fro
m men's veins and put in water instead, then there will be no more war! Old women
's nonsenseold women's nonsense!" he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affecti
onately on the shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew, evide
ntly not wishing to join in the conversation, was looking over the papers his fat
her had brought from town. The old prince went up to him and began to talk busine
ss.  "The marshal, a Count Rostov, hasn't sent half his contingent. He came to to
wn and wanted to invite me to dinnerI gave him a pretty dinner!... And there, loo
k at this.... Well, my boy," the old prince went on, addressing his son and patti
ng Pierre on the shoulder. "A fine fellowyour friendI like him! He stirs me up. A
nother says clever things and one doesn't care to listen, but this one talks rubb
ish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps I'll come and sit wi
th you at supper. We'll have another dispute. Make friends with my little fool, P
rincess Mary," he shouted after Pierre, through the door.  Only now, on his visit
 to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the strength and charm of his friendship
 with Prince Andrew. That charm was not expressed so much in his relations with h
im as with all his family and with the household. With the stern old prince and t
he gentle, timid Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre at once
 felt like an old friend. They were all fond of him already. Not only Princess Ma
ry, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her most radia
nt looks, but even the oneyearold "Prince Nicholas" as his grandfather called him
 smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his arms, and Michael Ivanovich and
 Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the 
old prince.  The old prince came in to supper this was evidently on Pierre's acco
unt. And during the two days of the young man's visit he was extremely kind to hi
m and told him to visit them again.  When Pierre had gone and the members of the 
household met together, they began to express their opinions of him as people alw
ays do after a new acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anyt
hing but what was good of him.      CHAPTER XV   When returning from his leave, R
ostov felt, for the first time, how close was the bond that united him to Denisov
 and the whole regiment.  On approaching it, Rostov felt as he had done when appr
oaching his home in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned unif
orm of his regiment, when he recognized redhaired Dementyev and saw the picket ro
pes of the roan horses, when Lavrushka gleefully shouted to his master, "The coun
t has come!" and Denisov, who had been asleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out 
of the mud hut to embrace him, and the officers collected round to greet the new 
arrival, Rostov experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and 
his sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could not spe
ak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and precious as his par
ents' house.  When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and h
ad been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone out fora
ging, when he had again entered into all the little interests of the regiment and
 felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow, unchanging frame, he e
xperienced the same sense of peace, of moral support, and the same sense of being
 at home here in his own place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here 
was none of all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his rig
ht place and took mistaken decisions here was no Sonya with whom he ought, or oug
ht not, to have an explanation here was no possibility of going there or not goin
g there here there were not twentyfour hours in the day which could be spent in s
uch a variety of ways there was not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not 
one was nearer to him or farther from him than another there were none of those u
ncertain and undefined money relations with his father, and nothing to recall tha
t terrible loss to Dolokhov. Here, in the regiment, all was clear and simple. The
 whole world was divided into two unequal parts one, our Pavlograd regiment the o
ther, all the rest. And the rest was no concern of his. In the regiment, everythi
ng was definite who was lieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad
 one, and most of all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, one'
s pay came every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide, you had o
nly to do nothing that was considered bad in the Pavlograd regiment and, when giv
en an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly, and definitely orderedand all wo
uld be well.  Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regim
ental life, Rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to res
t. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter for him, be
cause, after his loss to Dolokhov for which, in spite of all his family's efforts
 to console him, he could not forgive himself, he had made up his mind to atone f
or his fault by serving, not as he had done before, but really well, and by being
 a perfectly firstrate comrade and officerin a word, a splendid man altogether, a
 thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the regimen
t.  After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in fi
ve years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved to take only t
wo thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his parents.  Our army, after
 repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pultusk and PreussischEylau, was c
oncentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the Emperor's arrival and the begin
ning of a new campaign.  The Pavlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the ar
my which had served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in R
ussia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign. It
 had been neither at Pultusk nor at PreussischEylau and, when it joined the army 
in the field in the second half of the campaign, was attached to Platov's divisio
n.  Platov's division was acting independently of the main army. Several times pa
rts of the Pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy, had taken priso
ners, and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot's carriages. In April the Pavlog
rads were stationed immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted G
erman village.  A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river br
oke, and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the men nor
 fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could arrive, the men di
spersed about the abandoned and deserted villages, searching for potatoes, but fo
und few even of these.  Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all 
fledif any remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken
 from them even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking anything
 from them, often gave them the last of their rations.  The Pavlograd regiment ha
d had only two men wounded in action, but had lost nearly half its men from hunge
r and sickness. In the hospitals, death was so certain that soldiers suffering fr
om fever, or the swelling that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, a
nd hardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals.
 When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground t
hat looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called "Mashka's sweet ro
ot." It was very bitter, but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it
 out with their sabers and ate it, though they were ordered not to do so, as it w
as a noxious plant. That spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers, a swe
lling of the arms, legs, and face, which the doctors attributed to eating this ro
ot. But in spite of all this, the soldiers of Denisov's squadron fed chiefly on "
Mashka's sweet root," because it was the second week that the last of the biscuit
s were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes re
ceived had sprouted and frozen.  The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on 
straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered 
with tufts of felty winter hair.  Despite this destitution, the soldiers and offi
cers went on living just as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered 
uniforms, the hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed th
eir horses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in plac
e of fodder, and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up hung
ry, joking about their nasty food and their hunger. As usual, in their spare time
, they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before them naked smoked, picked out and 
baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told and listened to stories of Potemkin's and S
uvorov's campaigns, or to legends of Alesha the Sly, or the priest's laborer Miko
lka.  The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless, halfruine
d houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and, in general, food f
or the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as before, some playing cards th
ere was plenty of money, though there was no food, some with more innocent games,
 such as quoits and skittles. The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken
 of, partly because nothing certain was known about it, partly because there was 
a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly.  Rostov lived, as before, wi
th Denisov, and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever. Den
isov never spoke of Rostov's family, but by the tender friendship his commander s
howed him, Rostov felt that the elder hussar's luckless love for Natasha played a
 part in strengthening their friendship. Denisov evidently tried to expose Rostov
 to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his safe return wit
h evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in a deserted and ruined villa
ge to which he had come in search of provisions, Rostov found a family consisting
 of an old Pole and his daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad, hun
gry, too weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance. Ros
tov brought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and kept them f
or some weeks while the old man was recovering. One of his comrades, talking of w
omen, began chaffing Rostov, saying that he was more wily than any of them and th
at it would not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he
 had saved. Rostov took the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasan
t things to the officer that it was all Denisov could do to prevent a duel. When 
the officer had gone away, Denisov, who did not himself know what Rostov's relati
ons with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid him for his quickness of temp
er, and Rostov replied  "Say what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I 
can't tell you how it offended me... because... well, for that reason...."  Denis
ov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room without looking a
t Rostov, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.  "Ah, what a mad bweed you W
ostovs are!" he muttered, and Rostov noticed tears in his eyes.      CHAPTER XVI 
  In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor's arrival, but Rostov
 had no chance of being present at the review he held at Bartenstein, as the Pavl
ograds were at the outposts far beyond that place.  They were bivouacking. Deniso
v and Rostov were living in an earth hut, dug out for them by the soldiers and ro
ofed with branches and turf. The hut was made in the following manner, which had 
then come into vogue. A trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eigh
t inches deep, and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out 
and these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room, in w
hich the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board, lying on piles 
at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On each side of the trench
, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet, and this did d
uty for bedsteads and couches. The roof was so constructed that one could stand u
p in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close
 to the table. Denisov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his sq
uadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end, with a piece o
f broken but mended glass in it for a window. When it was very cold, embers from 
the soldiers' campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the "r
eception room"as Denisov called that part of the hutand it was then so warm that 
the officers, of whom there were always some with Denisov and Rostov, sat in thei
r shirt sleeves.  In April, Rostov was on orderly duty. One morning, between seve
n and eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed his r
ainsoaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm, then tidied up the
 things on the table and in his own corner, and, his face glowing from exposure t
o the wind and with nothing on but his shirt, lay down on his back, putting his a
rms under his head. He was pleasantly considering the probability of being promot
ed in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting Denisov
, who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.  Suddenly he heard D
enisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut, evidently much excited. Rost
ov moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to, and saw the quartermaster,
 Topcheenko.  "I ordered you not to let them eat that Mashka woot stuff!" Denisov
 was shouting. "And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fi
elds."  "I have given the order again and again, your honor, but they don't obey,
" answered the quartermaster.  Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought compl
acently "Let him fuss and bustle now, my job's done and I'm lying downcapitally!"
 He could hear that Lavrushkathat sly, bold orderly of Denisov'swas talking, as w
ell as the quartermaster. Lavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons, bis
cuits, and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions.  Then Denisov's 
voice was heard shouting farther and farther away. "Saddle! Second platoon!"  "Wh
ere are they off to now?" thought Rostov.  Five minutes later, Denisov came into 
the hut, climbed with muddy boots on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered h
is things about, took his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. 
In answer to Rostov's inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly
 that he had some business.  "Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!"
 said Denisov going out, and Rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing t
hrough the mud. He did not even trouble to find out where Denisov had gone. Havin
g got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward ev
ening. Denisov had not yet returned. The weather had cleared up, and near the nex
t hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka, laughing as they threw their 
missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud. Rostov joined them. In the midd
le of the game, the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on 
their skinny horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to th
e picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.  "There now, Denisov has b
een worrying," said Rostov, "and here are the provisions."  "So they are!" said t
he officers. "Won't the soldiers be glad!"  A little behind the hussars came Deni
sov, accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking.  Rostov went 
to meet them.  "I warn you, Captain," one of the officers, a short thin man, evid
ently very angry, was saying.  "Haven't I told you I won't give them up?" replied
 Denisov.  "You will answer for it, Captain. It is mutinyseizing the transport of
 one's own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days."  "And mine have h
ad nothing for two weeks," said Denisov.  "It is robbery! You'll answer for it, s
ir!" said the infantry officer, raising his voice.  "Now, what are you pestewing 
me for?" cried Denisov, suddenly losing his temper. "I shall answer for it and no
t you, and you'd better not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!" he sh
outed at the officers.  "Very well, then!" shouted the little officer, undaunted 
and not riding away. "If you are determined to rob, I'll..."  "Go to the devil! q
uick ma'ch, while you're safe and sound!" and Denisov turned his horse on the off
icer.  "Very well, very well!" muttered the officer, threateningly, and turning h
is horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.  "A dog astwide a fence! A weal 
dog astwide a fence!" shouted Denisov after him the most insulting expression a c
avalryman can address to a mounted infantryman and riding up to Rostov, he burst 
out laughing.  "I've taken twansports from the infantwy by force!" he said. "Afte
r all, can't let our men starve."  The wagons that had reached the hussars had be
en consigned to an infantry regiment, but learning from Lavrushka that the transp
ort was unescorted, Denisov with his hussars had seized it by force. The soldiers
 had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared them with the other 
squadrons.  The next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov, and holding h
is fingers spread out before his eyes said  "This is how I look at this affair I 
know nothing about it and won't begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over 
to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if 
possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received. If not, as the demand 
was booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row and the affair may e
nd badly."  From the regimental commander's, Denisov rode straight to the staff w
ith a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came back to his du
gout in a state such as Rostov had never yet seen him in. Denisov could not speak
 and gasped for breath. When Rostov asked what was the matter, he only uttered so
me incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse, feeble voice.  Alarmed at Denisov's 
condition, Rostov suggested that he should undress, drink some water, and send fo
r the doctor.  "Twy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but
 I'll always thwash scoundwels... and I'll tell the Empewo'... Ice..." he muttere
d.  The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary to blee
d Denisov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only the
n was he able to relate what had happened to him.  "I get there," began Denisov. 
"'Now then, where's your chief's quarters?' They were pointed out. 'Please to wai
t.' 'I've widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait. A
nnounce me.' Vewy well, so out comes their head chiefalso took it into his head t
o lecture me 'It's wobbewy!''Wobbewy,' I say, 'is not done by man who seizes pwov
isions to feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets!' 
'Will you please be silent?' 'Vewy good!' Then he says 'Go and give a weceipt to 
the commissioner, but your affair will be passed on to headquarters.' I go to the
 commissioner. I enter, and at the table... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!
... Who is it that's starving us?" shouted Denisov, hitting the table with the fi
st of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tu
mblers on it jumped about. "Telyanin! 'What? So it's you who's starving us to dea
th! Is it? Take this and this!' and I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... 'A
h, what a... what a...!' and I sta'ted fwashing him... Well, I've had a bit of fu
n I can tell you!" cried Denisov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing 
under his black mustache. "I'd have killed him if they hadn't taken him away!"  "
But what are you shouting for? Calm yourself," said Rostov. "You've set your arm 
bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up again."  Denisov was bandaged up again a
nd put to bed. Next day he woke calm and cheerful.  But at noon the adjutant of t
he regiment came into Rostov's and Denisov's dugout with a grave and serious face
 and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to Major Denisov from the regiment
al commander in which inquiries were made about yesterday's occurrence. The adjut
ant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a courtmart
ial had been appointed, and that in view of the severity with which marauding and
 insubordination were now regarded, degradation to the ranks would be the best th
at could be hoped for.  The case, as represented by the offended parties, was tha
t, after seizing the transports, Major Denisov, being drunk, went to the chief qu
artermaster and without any provocation called him a thief, threatened to strike 
him, and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a th
rashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.  In answer to Rostov's renewed qu
estions, Denisov said, laughing, that he thought he remembered that some other fe
llow had got mixed up in it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did
 not in the least fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared atta
ck him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget.  Denisov s
poke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rostov knew him too well not to dete
ct that while hiding it from others at heart he feared a courtmartial and was wor
ried over the affair, which was evidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters o
f inquiry and notices from the court arrived, and on the first of May, Denisov wa
s ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before th
e staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office. On th
e previous day Platov reconnoitered with two Cossack regiments and two squadrons 
of hussars. Denisov, as was his wont, rode out in front of the outposts, parading
 his courage. A bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part 
of his leg. Perhaps at another time Denisov would not have left the regiment for 
so slight a wound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appeari
ng at the staff and went into hospital.      CHAPTER XVII   In June the battle of
 Friedland was fought, in which the Pavlograds did not take part, and after that 
an armistice was proclaimed. Rostov, who felt his friend's absence very much, hav
ing no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the
 progress of his affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit D
enisov in hospital.  The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twic
e devastated by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so b
eautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly dismal appea
rance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets, tattered inhabitants, a
nd the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.  The hospital was in a brick bu
ilding with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded
 by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandage
d soldiers, with pale swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshin
e in the yard.  Directly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of p
utrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army doctor smoking 
a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.  "I can't tear myself to
 pieces," the doctor was saying. "Come to Makar Alexeevich in the evening. I shal
l be there."  The assistant asked some further questions.  "Oh, do the best you c
an! Isn't it all the same?" The doctor noticed Rostov coming upstairs.  "What do 
you want, sir?" said the doctor. "What do you want? The bullets having spared you
, do you want to try typhus? This is a pesthouse, sir."  "How so?" asked Rostov. 
 "Typhus, sir. It's death to go in. Only we two, Makeev and I" he pointed to the 
assistant, "keep on here. Some five of us doctors have died in this place.... Whe
n a new one comes he is done for in a week," said the doctor with evident satisfa
ction. "Prussian doctors have been invited here, but our allies don't like it at 
all."  Rostov explained that he wanted to
